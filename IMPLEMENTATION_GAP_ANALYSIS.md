# Implementation Gap Analysis
**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Comparison**: What we've built vs. RUNNING.md requirements

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

### What We've Built
- ✅ **Railway Infrastructure**: 6 services operational (Prefect, Postgres, Redis, Kafka, MinIO)
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Core tables (bills, politicians, fetch_logs)
- ✅ **Prefect Orchestration**: 3 flows created (fetch_latest_bills, fetch_parliament_session, monitor)
- ✅ **Basic API**: FastAPI with bills and politicians endpoints
- ✅ **Basic Frontend**: Next.js 14 with homepage showing stats
- ⚠️ **Railway Deployment**: Frontend deploying, worker service needs fixing

### Critical Gaps
- ❌ **Worker Service**: `intuitive-flow` failed, needs replacement with Prefect worker
- ❌ **Full Schema**: Missing votes, debates, committees, documents, embeddings tables
- ❌ **RSS/Atom Feeds**: Not implemented
- ❌ **GraphQL**: Not implemented
- ❌ **Graph Visualization**: Not implemented
- ❌ **RAG/Embeddings**: Not implemented
- ❌ **Search**: No hybrid BM25+vector search
- ❌ **Frontend Pages**: Only homepage, missing bills list, detail, graph, search pages

## 🚨 Critical Missing Components

### 1. **Schema Completion** (PRIORITY: HIGH)
Missing tables that block major features:
- `votes` and `vote_record` - needed for vote tracking
- `debates` and `speeches` - needed for Hansard integration
- `committees` and `committee_meetings` - needed for committee tracking
- `documents` and `embeddings` - needed for RAG/search
- `ranking` - needed for bill prioritization
- `ignored_bill` and `personalized_feed_token` - needed for personalization

### 2. **RSS/Atom Feeds** (PRIORITY: HIGH)
Completely missing:
- No feed generation infrastructure
- No feed endpoints
- No caching strategy
- No rate limiting for feeds
- This is a core feature per RUNNING.md

### 3. **Graph Visualization** (PRIORITY: HIGH)
Missing both backend and frontend:
- No graph API endpoints
- No node/edge data structures
- No React Flow implementation
- No force-directed or hierarchical layouts
- This is a core differentiator per RUNNING.md

### 4. **RAG Pipeline** (PRIORITY: MEDIUM)
Completely missing:
- No embedding generation
- No vector search
- No LLM integration for summaries
- No citation system
- No guardrails

### 5. **Multi-Jurisdiction Support** (PRIORITY: LOW)
Currently hardcoded to `ca-federal`:
- No jurisdiction table
- No jurisdiction parameterization
- No jurisdiction switcher UI

### 6. **Personalization** (PRIORITY: MEDIUM)
Missing all personalization features:
- No device ignores
- No personalized feeds
- No ranking weight customization
- No anon_id system

### 7. **Search** (PRIORITY: MEDIUM)
Basic text search only:
- No hybrid BM25 + vector search
- No materialized views for search
- No result snippets with highlights
- No advanced query parsing

### 8. **Frontend Pages** (PRIORITY: HIGH)
Only homepage exists:
- No bills list page
- No bill detail page
- No search page
- No settings page
- No graph canvas page

### 9. **Testing & Observability** (PRIORITY: MEDIUM)
Minimal testing and monitoring:
- No load testing
- No security testing
- No comprehensive integration tests
- No dashboards
- No alerts
- No status page

## ✅ What Actually Works Well

### Strong Foundations
1. **Railway Infrastructure**: All 6 services operational and properly configured
2. **Database Layer**: Core tables with proper migrations and upsert logic
3. **Prefect Orchestration**: Solid flow definitions with scheduling
4. **Bill ETL**: Working adapter for OpenParliament API with robust error handling
5. **Basic API**: FastAPI with clean architecture and Pydantic models
6. **Frontend Foundation**: Next.js 14 with modern stack (React Query, Tailwind, TypeScript)

### Good Practices
- Clean separation of concerns (adapters, repositories, services)
- Async/await patterns throughout
- Environment-based configuration
- Git history with clear commits
- Type safety with Pydantic and TypeScript

---

## 🎯 Recommended Priorities

### **NOW** (Blocking Deployment)
1. ✅ Fix Railway worker service (replace `intuitive-flow` with Prefect worker)
2. ✅ Deploy Prefect flows to Railway
3. ✅ Validate data persistence end-to-end
4. ✅ Complete frontend Railway deployment

### **NEXT** (Core Features - 2 Weeks)
1. Complete Phase B Schema (votes, debates, committees, documents)
2. Build RSS/Atom feed infrastructure (Phase E5.8-E5.11)
3. Create bills list and detail pages (Phase F6.4-F6.5)
4. Implement basic search page (Phase F6.7)

### **THEN** (Differentiators - 2 Weeks)
1. Build graph API and visualization (Phase E5.3 + F6.6)
2. Implement RAG pipeline for summaries (Phase G7.1-G7.4)
3. Add personalization system (Phase B2.5 + E5.5)
4. Complete ranking system (Phase G7.5-G7.6)

### **LATER** (Polish - 1 Week)
1. Add remaining adapters (Hansard, committees, votes)
2. Build settings page and device ignores UI
3. Add GraphQL layer
4. Implement rate limiting and caching

### **FINALLY** (Launch Prep - 1 Week)
1. Load and security testing
2. Set up monitoring dashboards
3. Configure alerts
4. Create status page
5. Write documentation

## 📝 Notes

- **Total Effort Estimate**: 6-8 weeks from current state to launch-ready
- **Current State**: MVP infrastructure in place, 32% of planned features complete
- **Biggest Gap**: Frontend (90% missing) and feeds (100% missing)
- **Strength**: Solid backend foundation with clean architecture
- **Risk**: Scope creep - RUNNING.md is comprehensive, may need to prioritize ruthlessly
