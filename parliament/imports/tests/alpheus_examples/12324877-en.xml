              <ParaText id="7932005"> Welcome to meeting number 53 of the Standing Committee on Science and Research.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932006">Today's meeting is taking place in a hybrid format, pursuant to the Standing Orders. Members are in person in this room, and we have a witness via Zoom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932007">I will make a few comments for the benefit of the witness. Please wait until I recognize you by name before speaking. Click on the microphone icon to activate your mike. When speaking, speak slowly and clearly for the interpreters. Also, when you're not speaking, your mike should be on mute. You also have the option of interpretation for your convenience. You can choose floor, English or French.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932008">Although this room is equipped with a powerful audio system, feedback can occur, so be very careful with your earphone and the microphone. Keep them apart so we can prevent injuries to our interpreters. It's great to see our witness using a House of Commons-approved device, which is now mandatory. The sound checks have been done, so we should be good to go on that front. In accordance with the committee's routine motion concerning connection tests for witnesses, I can let you know that the witness has completed all the checks that are needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932009"> To the members, I remind you to address your comments through the chair.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932010">Welcome to Larry Maguire. It's good to have you joining us as a substitute on the committee. We also have Heath MacDonald joining us as a sub.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932011">Thank you to our witnesses for preparing to be here, both in person and virtually, to help us with the study we're working on. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932012">Pursuant to Standing Order 108(3)(i) and the motion adopted by the committee on Tuesday, June 6, 2023, the committee will commence its study on the use of federal government research and development grants, funds and contributions by Canadian universities and research institutions in partnerships with entities connected to the People's Republic of China. I wish we had a short version of that, but even taking one letter would take me a while. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932013">It's my pleasure to welcome our witnesses today. From Alliance Canada Hong Kong, we have Cherie Wong, who is the executive director. Welcome back to the House of Commons as a witness. Benjamin Fung, welcome to the House of Commons for your first time. Benjamin is a Canada research chair and a professor at McGill University.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932014">We also have, joining us from the University of Alberta—and I think I heard you say you are in British Columbia right now—Gordon Houlden, who is a professor and also works with the China Institute. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932015">You will each have five minutes for your opening remarks. I believe the five minutes are going to be split between our first witnesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932016">You can start with your presentation.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7932017"> Good afternoon, Chair and committee members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932018">I am a professor and Canada research chair at McGill University. My research interests include AI, cybersecurity, and malware analysis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932019">The CCP and Chinese state-affiliated companies have expressed strong interest in my research. In the past years, a large Chinese 5G company repeatedly approached me for different collaborations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932020">In 2018, a Chinese company attempted to recruit me as a consultant for their AI team. That company offered three times—yes, three times—my salary to work for them as a consultant while remaining a professor at McGill. Out of curiosity, I asked them, “What do you want me to do?” Their response was, “You just need to reply to our emails.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932021">In Chinese, this recruitment strategy is called “feed, trap and kill”. They first use lucrative offers to attract their targets. Once a professor relies on their funding, they will start making unreasonable requests, including transferring IP rights, getting sensitive data or asking the professor to say something that may not be true.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932022">After I rejected their offer, they contacted me every one or two years to offer different types of collaborations. They also started to approach my graduate students. Fortunately, none of my students have joined the company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932023">Through the China Scholarship Council, CSC, many international students from China are fully funded to study and participate in research in Canada. Not many people understand that international students face undue pressure in funding agreements with the Chinese government. If the students violate a rule or refuse to follow instructions, the Chinese government will ask their family to pay back the scholarship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932024">As a professor, I fully understand and respect the importance of academic freedom, but universities have the responsibility to explain the risks to professors who take CSC-sponsored students into their research teams. Some of the risks can be mitigated if university research officers are educated in identifying foreign interference and foreign state entities. I'm happy to share other CCP infiltrations in the academic community. Thank you.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932025">Now I will pass the floor to Cherie.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7932026"> Mr. Chair, I have witnessed Beijing's influence in Canadian academia and the research sector, having heard through ACHK from these concerned community members, and also through my own observations as a graduate student in the sociology and anthropology department at Carleton University.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932027">On the surface, the soft sciences may not directly contribute to Beijing's technological and military ambitions, but what we're seeing is the Chinese party state weaving other regime security objectives such as elite capture, censorship, disinformation and narrative discursion into these areas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932028">I'd like to stress this important point: While Chinese interference is gaining significant scrutiny in Canada, Beijing will not be the only foreign principal interested in Canadian research. We must create country-agnostic solutions to address vulnerabilities in academia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932029">Whether they are domestic or international students, Tibetans, Uyghurs, Chinese, Taiwanese and Hong Kongers are experiencing transnational surveillance and fear of reprisal on university campuses. International students have also expressed their concerns that embassies, consulates and their home governments might revoke study permits or scholarships for unfavourable views, actions or inactions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932030">Academic freedom requires ongoing work to proactively adapt to and meet new challenges as they arise. Canada must strengthen its academic and research environment, which will require whole-of-society collaboration with universities, research institutions, the private sector and student unions. When collaborating with individuals outside of Canada, we must also consider the risk and the intention of our international partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932031">Stronger privacy and data protection laws can prevent Canadians' sensitive data from being transferred, exported or sold to foreign actors, and can encourage Canadian universities and research institutions to keep university servers and research data in Canada, as well as to implement stronger cybersecurity measures and policies on campus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932032">I strongly encourage the committee to review Alliance Canada Hong Kong's previous report, “In Plain Sight”, particularly the chapter “Academic Influence and Vulnerability of Intellectual Property Transfer”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932035">Thank you very much. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932036">Chair, I intend to use my full five minutes, if that's possible. Don't hesitate to cut me off, of course. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932037">I wish to thank the chair and the members of the committee for this opportunity. It's always an honour to speak to our House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932038">The topic of research security has gained in profile and significance in pace with the rise of the PRC to global status as a near peer to the United States in terms of national power. The reality that China is a potential adversary to Canada, combined with China's sharply different political system, requires that attention be paid to risks that may arise from the leakage of Canadian intellectual property and know-how from our leading post-secondary institutions and corporate research laboratories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932039">In May of this year, I presented to the Government of Alberta a comprehensive confidential report on academic research security, which they had commissioned and which took several months of research. The subject, as you know and as you've already heard this morning, is complex, as is often the case in international relations, and our G7 allies have also paid much closer attention to this issue as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932040">However, a policy response requires careful examination and thought in order to avoid unintended consequences. In academic relationships with China, the emphasis should be on the protection but also the promotion of Canadian interests. These interests include advancing Canada's S and T prowess, while protecting and safeguarding our research accomplishments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932041">Now in my 37th year of full-time work on China as both a diplomat and an academic, I am wary of simplistic approaches towards a state as complex as China.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932042">China now graduates roughly twice the number of university graduates as the United States, but approximately eight times as many STEM graduates—science, technology, engineering and mathematics. These numbers, projected over several years, have given the PRC a world-class research capacity, further bolstered by the network of private high-tech firms and state and corporate research laboratories. That advantage will grow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932043"> Chinese universities and research labs are lavishly supported with state funds. We see the PRC's S and T development perhaps most dramatically in the Chinese space program, with a planned lunar base, a permanent earth-orbiting space station and Mars missions, but Chinese health research is also one of the factors behind the reality that China's life expectancy now exceeds that of the United States. Several decades ago, in Hong Kong, where I was serving in our mission, my son's use of his hand was restored after an injury by an application of the early PRC development of microsurgery techniques, which are now in broad international application.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932044">The point is that we need to draw from China as much advanced knowledge as possible while minimizing risks associated with sensitive technologies that either involve security risks to Canada or are needed to protect our own accomplishments from theft. My premise is that cutting off all federal funding to co-operative research with China risks isolating Canadian researchers from key S and T developments within China to the detriment of our own research, particularly if we are not in alignment with our allies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932045">The tricky part is not whether we should fund projects in co-operation with Chinese researchers, but whether the co-operation is, in each case, in Canada's net interest. In my opinion, the Canadian government, led by ISED, has the capacity to lead on the evaluation of funding proposals with the involvement of CSIS, GAC, DND and other agencies and also taking outside advice from our own researchers and our allies as necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932046">What is urgently needed, I believe, is the development within ISED of a list of problematic PRC entities—and this may already be in process—such as the PLA-dominated national University of Science and Technology, where research collaboration carries clear risks. This list of problematic research should be paired with a list of problematic research topics that would exclude any shared research on those topics no matter the Chinese partner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932047">Our allies are doing this. When I called on the U.S. State Department in Washington in late 2022, I was told that the overarching U.S. government approach to scientific co-operation with China was to “promote and protect”: that is, to continue to promote academic research with the PRC, but to be vigilant in protecting U.S. research and researchers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932048">The U.S. National Institutes of Health, the largest funder of medical research in the world, has not cut off funding of joint U.S.-China medical research. What they have done instead is implement controls on the nature of research and administrative measures to ensure that U.S. and PRC researchers comply with NIH regulations, because there have been cases where this has not been the case.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="7932049"> In Europe, Germany, France, the U.K. and the EU itself have not stopped research co-operation with China. They have, rather, proposed or implemented measures to reduce risks involving sensitive technologies that are key to either European security or the health of European research institutions and high-tech companies.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932067">It's a typical strategy that the Chinese government often uses to recruit researchers. Once a professor has the funding, they will start expanding their team. Let's say they will hire more Ph.D. students and more graduate students. A Ph.D. student typically takes four to five years to complete their degree. After one or two years, as professors, we rely on that funding. We rely on that company to keep providing that funding; otherwise, we cannot support the Ph.D. students. That's the moment. That is the trap. That's the moment when the company or the CCP government may ask the professor to do something that may go against their own will.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932094">As you've mentioned, Professor, this is a rather complex issue. It is important that the research ecosystem be as open as possible and as secure as necessary. Our government, certainly, has been working towards improving research security in Canada for some time. In 2021, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada released its “National Security Guidelines for Research Partnerships”. This took aim at supporting researchers “to integrate national security considerations into the development, evaluation, and funding of research partnerships.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932095">Can you reaffirm some of your concerns, then, with how we proceed to limit the extent of collaboration with certain countries, to be agnostic yet at the same time provide for research that is open and allows us to benefit from the degree of expertise that exists in other parts of the world?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="7932096">Well, resources and time are always limited.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932097">My point would be that I'm not sure you can always be agnostic. It's pretty clear that the PRC, North Korea, Iran and Russia pose risks that others do not. Hence, I'd argue that focusing on the most immediate problems is rational.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932098">Our collaboration with China is for a bunch of reasons, mainly the fact that the Chinese have advanced so quickly and so far. China will probably occupy the lion's share. I'm not aware of any research collaboration with North Korea, for example. There's virtually none with Iran and very little with Russia in the current circumstances. I think you have to pick your targets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932099">The challenge is that one must, in my view, respect the academic autonomy of universities. Where there's a legitimate security concern—and there are legitimate security concerns—is where the Government of Canada legitimately focuses. When it has the funding control, it should certainly exercise it where it believes it's not in the net interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932100">I would emphasize that there are research topics—be it climate change, environmental concerns or health research—where there is clear benefit to Canada from our researchers' working with Chinese researchers. If you cut that off completely, then one of the things you're going to find is that some of our best researchers will simply decamp to the U.S. or Europe, where there are no such barriers or where at least the barriers may be somewhat more liberal. Working with our allies to find common approaches reduces that risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932101">There's also the bigger issue of isolating China. China went through very long periods historically, including up to the end of the cultural revolution.... The movement of students back and forth, I think, helps to leaven and open Chinese society. The Chinese students I deal with on a regular basis are far more knowledgeable of the outside world and outside ways of living than was the case before.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932104">This is obviously a very serious issue. What you've highlighted today in terms of the security threat and what is not a threat.... You've actually identified and have said that there's interference being engaged at this moment by some of your colleagues who are targets, as you have also been. That's a very serious issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932105">I've also heard—from members of the diaspora, members of the Chinese community and others who are students and so forth—that there's some degree of concern and worry about racism, discrimination and some biases against certain researchers of Chinese origin. As a consequence, many are calling for a full boycott. They're calling for what seems like maybe an ineffective method, but some are saying to cut everything and not to deal with certain individuals from China.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932107">I think what you mean by a country-agnostic solution is the start of an anti-racist approach in addressing national security concerns when it comes to academia. As I said, there is also other regime security in academia that Beijing is interested in advancing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932108">I think that, for one thing, we need to look at the conduct of the companies, individuals and entities we collaborate with. For example, if an entity seeking to collaborate with a Canadian researcher is actively violating international human rights law, then that should be a signal that maybe we shouldn't collaborate with that individual. That's what I mean by looking at the conduct rather than the country of origin. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932109">Another issue, when it comes to international collaboration, is that there are privacy laws and data laws that are different from Canada's, so we can collaborate with a Chinese actor who has obtained data legally in China, but the way they obtained the data may not be legal in Canada. That then creates this kind of moral grey area in which we have to ask whether it is ethical for Canadian researchers to continue to collaborate with this individual, who has obtained data possibly through means that are not legal in Canada but that would be elsewhere. How would that research data be stored? Is it stored in China or is it stored in Canada? </ParaText>

There is a group of independent democratic countries, largely in Europe but in other continents as well, with which I think concerns are modest, and then there are the countries where, because of their size—in the case of China—and radically different political systems, non-democratic, with larger militaries, caution is more warranted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932130"> That's on a national basis, but even within that, you'll have to differentiate between the types of research. It's quite feasible that a Canadian researcher might be working with a German researcher who, unbeknownst to the Canadian researcher, has a Chinese partner, so caution is needed as well. If I were the Canadian researcher, I would ask, “Who are your partners? Who else are you working with?” Once it's leaked from that lab in Canada or from the intellectual property of the individual, it's harder to control where it goes. However, there are issues of health, child health, aging, biodiversity, where it is clear that it's in the planet's interest, as well as China's and Canada's, that we collaborate and advance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932131">That's where there has to be this differentiation, not just on the country, but also on the subject matter, where governments, universities and researchers have categories of high risk, medium risk and no risk, and where the no risk category may have great benefit for all parties.</ParaText>

They have the most to protect, be it in the military or science or technology, and they have very large national institutions. But again, in Washington, from meeting with eight different individuals from various agencies, I know they have also worked very carefully to respect the autonomy of universities, to have a very light touch when possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932136"> They believe, as I believe, that there are too few North Americans studying in China. We need to understand that place. It's going to be a dominant part of the 21st century. We ought to have more researchers there. Many of these people can go without risk, depending on what the subject matter is. Again, if it's investigations of paleontology, there's zero risk, but you gain a knowledge of how the Chinese work and think. The French and Germans have just woken up to the risk.</ParaText>

After listening to Mr. Houlden, I'm wondering if maybe it's a bit of semantics that is the difference here. I assume that by “country-agnostic” you do not mean that China is out. You would say, let's look at the research, the topic of the research, the entity that you're dealing with—as Mr. Houlden was saying—and look at the level of risk and use that. Is that the kind of approach you're talking about, rather than just putting all the countries into different boxes from the start?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932147">Yes, definitely. One way to tackle this is to increase the research funding so that Canadian students, local students have more opportunities to do active research in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932148">Another way to tackle the problem is to inform the professors—basically, raise the awareness of the engineering and science professors. I see that Public Safety has safeguarded science programs. It's trying to raise awareness at universities. One of the meetings I attended when they came to McGill had an excellent presentation, but I saw that the attendees were not really from engineering and science. One way to tackle the problem is, I would say, to educate the professors, raise awareness and let them know the potential risk. That's very important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932149">Another level is at the research office. We need to train the research officers to identify what the potential foreign interference entities are. Sometimes this may require additional information from the government agencies.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932153">Your question is important. ISED is engaged in this process and has staffed up a lot of new people. I met many of them when I was in Ottawa. It is also putting funding into the major research universities to create research security positions, which are funded both by the university and by Ottawa and are often staffed by people with security backgrounds, including some from CSIS. It's a huge step forward. What a different place from where we were.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932154">However, what I'm still waiting for is a list of problematic institutions abroad—some of these will be Chinese and some of these will be Iranian or Russian—and a list of problematic areas. The tricky thing is that those areas are constantly changing. That which is cutting-edge and potentially dual-use today may be commonplace and in everything you touch in a few days, so that work must proceed at pace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932155">The other problem, which I identified in my research for the Government of Alberta, is that while the federal government and ISED.... The Government of Canada controls the funding that flows to researchers, but the provinces control the universities by power of the purse. There must be, in my view, a very close collaboration between the provincial and federal governments facilitating a common approach, because otherwise you have this powerful university that may or may not take advice from the federal government, and the federal government has.... I believe the federal funding for research in the universities—I'm guessing here—is in the range of about 20%. The bulk of the funding comes from the university itself.</ParaText>

Students have expressed that they are worried that they're not going to get certain scholarships in Canada because their views may differ from the views of the professors who are issuing the grants. This is a particular worry for individuals like me who are working in sociology. My research is focused on transnational repression, so it's quite sensitive in that sense. If I were to apply for a research grant, I would worry that, if a professor has pro-Beijing views, I would not get a scholarship issued to me. I think that's a very similar experience for individuals in the soft sciences when they are applying for scholarships and grants for their own research.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932203">Well, I can speak about the provinces more generally because I did a survey in the course of preparing my study for the Government of Alberta this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932204">There are a couple of things. Number one I may have already mentioned, which is that the bulk of the research funding is not from the federal government. The federal government can come up with a whole set of criteria and be absolutely rigid, but the material may still be going out the door. What's needed.... The provinces, except for the largest provinces.... Quebec, Ontario and B.C.—perhaps Alberta—may have the resources to do analysis as to the security risks. However, this is being done to the tune of billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by the federal government, agencies such as CSIS, CSE and other agencies of government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932205">To me, the answer is not 13 security agencies doing analysis. The answer is close collaboration between provinces and the federal government, sharing knowledge and coming up with common approaches. That, to me, is the best. Otherwise, if one province is tough and another is lenient, for example, foreign governments or agencies or individuals will go to the place of least resistance and take advantage of that slacker attitude. It's only if you have a unified national view of universities that's adopted with the full support of the provinces, in my view, that there's—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932220">We can always learn from our counterparts. I was a Canadian official for many years, but I never thought that the things Canadians did were always necessarily the very best. I wanted to find the best from elsewhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932221">Some of those countries you've mentioned are of a scale that is more applicable to us—be it the Netherlands or even France or the U.K. The U.S. is in many ways a special case. Australia is an interesting case. All of these countries, with the partial exception of the United States, are quite new to this game. If we go back a decade, we find that particularly vis-à-vis collaboration and co-operation with China, there were very few concerns. Yes, if something was on our export control list, then that's fine. If it was a weapons system, then fine, but apart from that.... What's happening now, though, is that so much research is dual-use. That which can be put to civilian use may also have a military application in communications or a range of things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932222">I would say we should study carefully what the Netherlands has done. Germany is doing some very interesting things, actually starting even just this summer in terms of tightening the controls. The tightening, I'd emphasize, for each of those countries, as well as for the EU, does not mean no collaboration with China. It means having eyes wide open, doing careful collaboration and looking at where this Chinese researcher is working, at which agency and also at the subject matter. If in doubt, say no and perhaps go elsewhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932223">Some of this would require legislation. If you're actually going to force academics not to collaborate with certain entities, you can use the carrot of money, even in federal-provincial things, but actually forbidding a professor from collaborating with a foreign entity would require a whole other degree of intervention that we don't have the tools for right now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932232">It would be a departure from our normal procedure. One of the great strengths, as in that MIT study, is the open nature of science in the United States and Canada. I think you have to tread carefully if you're going to come in with a legislative hammer on universities, which have lots of good reasons to want to be independent and autonomous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932233">I would rather argue that funding coming in really matters on the question of the subject matter. If the Chinese are helping the Canadian.... I happen to know a couple of researchers at the University of Alberta who came up, sometimes with their Chinese collaborators, with a vaccine for hepatitis C that will save, say, hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of lives. I don't think I really care where that money came from.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932234">If the subject matter is a cutting-edge dual-use matter, that's another thing, and I think that's where it would probably have to be a mix of federal and provincial legislation. I know how sensitive the provinces are, quite legitimately, about education being in their domain. This would be a diplomatic and legislative nightmare, but don't let the perfect get in the way of the good. Sensitizing universities, sensitizing the researchers and sensitizing parliamentarians and the public has advantages and risks, and it is a mix of both—absolutely a mix of both.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932235"> One of the great strengths in the MIT study, if you choose to read it, is that it points out how few U.S. scientists have been graduated compared to China, but the secret sauce that the Americans have and that Canada has is all this great talent we harvest from overseas. Chinese, Indian, Iranian and even Russian researcher students come to us and bring their knowledge to us. That's one of the ways we make up for that lack of enough internal candidates for top research jobs.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932254"> There is a substantial and persistent gender pay gap for faculty at Canadian universities. According to Statistics Canada, in 2023, full-time women faculty earned 7.4% less on average for the same work. The gender pay gap varied by institution, ranging from $150 a year to almost $25,000 a year, reflecting a gender pay gap of 0% to 15%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932255">Momani and colleagues demonstrated that pay gaps also vary by discipline—gender gaps are larger in STEM fields—and showed that the gender pay gap widens as women advance in academia and doubles for women who are deans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932256">The Canadian Association of University Teachers quantified diversity pay gaps for indigenous and racialized faculty, as well as looking at the intersection with gender. Using 2016 census data, they showed that indigenous university faculty, both men and women, earn 26% less than non-racialized men faculty. CAUT also found that racialized university faculty on average earned 12% less than faculty overall. There was a diversity pay gap for university faculty across all racialized groups, ranging from 3% to 28%. Moreover, the gender pay gap for racialized women faculty in Canada was double that for non-racialized women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932257">Many Canadian universities have used salary anomaly studies to investigate the gender pay gap at their institutions and have made positive salary adjustments either across the board to all women faculty or on an individual basis. These salary adjustments have not been retroactive at any university. Salary anomaly studies and salary corrections have been driven by collective bargaining between faculty associations and university employers rather than through legislation. Pay gaps still exist at universities, even after multiple rounds of adjustments, because without addressing a systemic bias that leads to pay differences, the gap is reintroduced in starting salaries and promotion and merit decisions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932258"> Four factors contribute to the gender wage gap in universities: disparities in starting salaries, differentials in performance and merit pay, differences in the rates of and times to promotion, and incongruities related to parental and other caregiving leaves. Although collective agreements identify salary floors for specific academic ranks, starting salaries largely continue to be negotiated, interpreted by university administrators who may or may not be cognizant of implicit gender bias. Women's experience and performance/merit are often undervalued in academic and other settings. Research has shown that in experiments where an identical resumé is presented, but either with a typical man's name or with a typical woman’s name, the candidates with a man's name are judged as more competent and are offered a higher starting salary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932259"> When applying to a national research council for funding, women need more than twice the academic output of men to receive the same competency score. Moreover, men's earnings rise significantly with academic productivity, whereas women's do not. Men are also more likely to be promoted, and women who are promoted take longer, on average, to be promoted than men, despite research that confirms that women are just as likely as men to ask for promotions and raises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932260">The take-up of parental and caregiving leave has further punitive effects that impact when women start their careers, the breaks they accumulate over their careers, and the decisions they make about when and whether to seek promotion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932261"> The gender pay gap clearly has long-term financial implications for women professors across their careers and retirements, but the cumulative impact has not previously been reported. In our research in collaboration with Dr. Aaron Cecala—now at Brescia University College—and Dr. Carol Agocs from Western University, we estimated the combined effects of the gender pay gap on salary and on employer pension plan earnings across a woman professor's career and retirement, using one Canadian institution as a case study. Taking the gender pay gap reported for that institution by Statistics Canada—approximately $9,000 in 2020—as a difference between starting salaries, we simulated career trajectories for a woman faculty member and a man faculty member just beginning their careers at the institution, and we calculated the cumulative difference using the institution’s salary and pension formulas. In our calculations, we made data-informed assumptions about the expected length of career, age of retirement, and lifespan. We also made a conservative estimate about salary increases: 1% per year, as per Bill 124 in Ontario.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932262">We found that the difference in starting salaries alone, with no difference in time to promotion, led to a gender gap in pay and pension of $454,000 across a career and retirement if both professors were promoted to associate professor, and $468,000 if both professors were promoted to full professor. However, men are more likely to be full professors than women; only three in 10 full professors in Canada are women. With the same difference in starting salary, if the woman was not promoted to full professor but her male colleague was, it led to a gender gap in pay and pension of $660,000 across a career and retirement. Our research shows that only looking at salary leads us to substantially underestimate the long-term effects of pay gaps. In retirement, the gender pension gap translated to a difference in employer pension of $7,000 to $12,250 per year—or $580 to $1,020 per month.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932263">Our calculations are a conservative estimate of the impact of the gender pay gap at Canadian universities. Importantly, unlike many universities, the case study institution does not have performance or merit pay or make market-value adjustments, which eliminates multiple decision points where bias could be introduced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932264">Our own work focused solely on gender, because race was not a variable provided in the Statistics Canada data that we used. Our values were based on all women professors combined. We know from others' work that the pay gap for racialized women professors in Canada is double that for non-racialized women, so the long-term financial impact of the gender pay and pension gap for racialized women professors will be larger than our calculations for women professors overall.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932265"> Here are our recommendations for your consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932266">First, gender pay equity studies will continue to be needed to rectify ongoing wage disparities. These should look at not only differences in pay, but the longer-term impacts of these differentials, including implications for pensionable incomes, both occupational and policy-related. Examples are CPP or QPP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932267">Second, more research on ways to remedy systemic biases against equity-denied groups in universities and broadly in society will be valuable in helping to meaningfully close the gap permanently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932268">Third, as it is being recognized and introduced in pay transparency legislation across Canada—including Bill 13 in B.C.—the promotion of transparency in salary negotiations and pay structures is vital to curb opportunities for bias to creep into salary, performance and promotional decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932269">Fourth, seeking to extend pay and pension equity provisions to equity-denied groups is imperative. This requires greater data collection, research and pay equity studies on the short- and long-term consequences not only of wage and pension differentials, but also of characteristics of the job—examples are unionization or the ability to gain tenure—and the ways in which informal labour, for example parental and caregiving work, yields significant labour disadvantages for some faculty more so than for others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932270">Fifth, independent research is needed to determine whether institutional pay equity studies and the interventions to address pay equity described therein are in fact remedying pay inequities. We recommend that Statistics Canada publish gender and diversity pay gaps at appropriate aggregate levels and make this information publicly available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932271">Finally, we recommend that institutions be required to provide gender and diversity pay gap information when applying for federal funding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932272">In closing, we commend SRSR for supporting Standing Order 108(3)(i), which we think is vital in providing more equitable pay for women faculty and academics from equity-denied groups. Our research shows that looking only at salary leads to a substantial underestimate of the long-term effects of pay gaps. We estimate that the impact of the gender pay and pension gap is $454,000 to $660,000 over the course of an academic career and retirement.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932279">Hello, everyone. My name is Dina Al-khooly. I’m here representing Visions of Science, where I am the director of impact of learning. I’m providing testimony from the perspective of an organization working with youth from low-income and racialized communities, with a focus on Black youth. We work to encourage our youth's participation and career pursuit in science, technology, engineering and math.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932280">While we have substantial evidence that illustrates and quantifies gender pay inequity, we have little data around other dimensions of marginalization, as the other witnesses have shared. A study by the Canadian Association of University Teachers found that racialized university educators are paid almost 15% less than their white counterparts. Another peer-reviewed study also found that racialized and indigenous professors earn lower wages, even after controlling for such variables as years of service and academic level. The Canadian Journal of Higher Education published a study that examined differences in tenure and promotion among faculty across eight Canadian universities. It found that racialized faculty had 54% lower odds of being tenured and 50% lower odds of being promoted to associate professor than non-racialized faculty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932281">This also impacts the next generation of scientists coming into the field. One way is through a lack of representation. As faculty are paid inequitably and pushed out in a variety of ways, few remain who can serve as inspiration, belonging and support for future faculty from their communities. Another is access to high pay. Youth from our communities are motivated by earning potential as a means of pulling themselves and their families out of poverty. Inadequate pay is an important deterrent for our youth wanting to pursue a career path.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932282">This is not only a matter of equity. Lived experience is both relevant and critical for expanding our knowledge economy. Studies have shown that under-represented groups produce higher rates of scientific novelty, and yet their novel contributions are taken up by other scholars at lower rates than their peers. Equally impactful contributions of gender and racial minorities are less likely to result in successful scientific careers. Canada ultimately pays for this in more narrow research and underutilized expertise, stifling divergent ways of thinking that are critical for innovation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932283">These gaps are caused by both education and employment barriers. Education barriers push students, especially Black and indigenous students, out of school at every level and prevent them from having the prerequisites required for university STEM education. Workplace barriers are through both outward and unconscious discrimination, nepotism, workplace culture that alienates marginalized faculty, and structural barriers that punish the essential work of teaching, mentoring, outreach and service that is disproportionately taken on by marginalized faculty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932284">At the workplace level, there is a lot that universities can do. They can designate faculty positions for those from marginalized communities. They can be intentional about elevating their work and providing opportunities for their promotion and uptake. They can reflect lived experience and responsibilities, such as teaching, outreach, mentoring, and committee and equity work—which ultimately benefits the university as well as the country as a whole—in their pay structure, workload and role expectations. They can increase transparency around compensation, promotion and tenure decisions. They can invest in the professional development of under-represented faculty to diversify their leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932285">We have such limited data that it enables people to continue to deny that these problems exist and keeps the issues under-researched. Universities should be required to publish data about their student body and their faculty by gender, race, indigeneity, disability, sexual orientation and gender identity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932286">Lastly, we cannot narrow our focus to just the tip of the iceberg. Early and ongoing investment is key. That means investing in education through financial support for both post-secondary and out-of-school-time learning that specifically serves those from marginalized communities. This we have found to be absolutely critical for building their capacity and belonging in STEM outside of the often alienating context of the classroom.</ParaText>

Do you have any reason or rationale as to why they would be doing this? As you say, they interpret the information however they want to.</ParaText>

In whatever role I was or whatever job I was doing, I tried to pay both exactly the same so there weren't any issues for me.

              <ParaText id="7932305"> As the other witnesses have mentioned, there are outward ways in which people can be discriminated against and implicit ways that are a part of how we move in our everyday lives and we don't even appreciate the ways in which we're marginalizing folks. For example, if in the conversations we have with a peer they have more similar lived experience to ours, then we might have a higher affinity with that person. We're more cordial with that person. When a promotional opportunity comes up, we're more likely to think of that person because we have that relationship with them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932306">It all comes down to discrimination, whether that's coming from bad intent or whether that is just kind of the natural way in which we move through the world. There are instances of both, of course. Part of this is not coming from a place of “Oh, I want to make sure that women and racialized professors are not advancing”, but if I'm more comfortable around certain people and those are the types of people I've been around my whole life, I'm going to, just given the nature of how I move in the world, alienate folks who are dissimilar to me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932307">It comes a lot from the leadership of the organization and how often those marginalized voices are actually given the power to make these decisions. If they're not, the people with the power are going to continue to reproduce these inequities just by the nature of how they move in the world.</ParaText>

However, that pertains to federally regulated employees, so it's only to a set group of employees and not broadly across the board.

              <ParaText id="7932316">As Dr. Penner noted earlier, the division of jobs based on classes that are male-oriented or female-oriented, in my mind, actually perpetuates some of this issue. “Which ones are the male-dominated fields and which are the female ones?” assumes that males should be in those fields and women should be in other fields.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932346">As Dr. Penner noted, universities are basically doing this out of goodwill. There isn't legislation suggesting that they must address it, although I think a lot of them would be under a lot of fire now, with equity, diversity, inclusion and decolonization plans in place, to address these issues. I think it's a combination of both faculty associations and administrators who are working on this.</ParaText>

It needs to be even broader to consider those members as well and not just the faculty association members.</ParaText>

As part of the application for those federal funds, asking institutions to provide information about their gender and other diversity pay gaps could be part of that process, in the same way that the federal government has played a role in rectifying what was a human rights complaint around Canada research chairs and gender and other diversity imbalances in those positions. I believe there's a role for both to play.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932410"> Yes. In terms of the pay equity studies that a number of institutions have taken on, several have made the salary adjustments that Dr. Penner mentioned earlier. Some of them have actually done it by giving a flat rate increase of a certain amount to all women faculty, and others have done some sort of a percentage increase. The issue, of course, is that some of them haven't embedded them within the pay structure. It's like a one-off payment, but that doesn't get it embedded into your regular salary moving forward. You're going to have to keep adjusting over time because you haven't embedded it into the pay structure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932411">None of those interventions thus far, or very few, have been so meaningful as to actually close the gap. They're usually just a portion of what would be necessary, so you have to keep adjusting over time and, of course, as time goes on, the gap keeps widening and it gets more expensive to keep trying to address it. If they actually were meaningfully addressing it and permanently trying to close it.... Obviously, that's not to say that we wouldn't need to keep addressing it. As long as this sexism is pervasive in society, we'll have to keep addressing it, but taking meaningful steps to close the gap is what we're suggesting is necessary.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932413"> How do we address that from a behavioural standpoint when there are so many decisions that are being made? There are upward mobility decisions or promotional decisions that are being made. There are obviously hiring decisions. I was involved in post-secondary institutions, quite a number of them, and often you progress from being a student to being a researcher. You go through different degrees and you eventually get hired on as faculty. Then, of course, you're moving through a whole system thereafter of promotional opportunities as you earn them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932424"> I will just add to my point about work-integrated learning. It sounds like it is something that other studies have discussed. The impacts of exploring academia on folks who are experiencing poverty cannot be overstated; it's an impossible trajectory for someone who is coming from a place of economic insecurity. It's about increasing those stipends for graduate students and funding work-integrated learning programs for people from low-income communities, particularly for racialized communities and women who are coming from racialized communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932428">I'll just quickly ask Dr. Smith-Carrier and Dr. Penner if there is anything in their research about some hopeful trend. I think the extent to which this is going on now is surprising to all of us, but is there a trend as we are getting more women at higher levels? You talked about pay gaps with deans, but I have women friends who are deans and women friends who are presidents of universities. Is there any trend that this process will result in a lessening pay gap when we have those hiring panels, perhaps with more women?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932429"> I would say that one area in which we see hope is that the representation—predominately at the lower ranks, but also rising—of women, indigenous faculty and racialized faculty has grown, so that's one area in which we see improvements. The Momani et al. study showed that the gaps are actually widening instead of narrowing, so that's an area that's of more concern. In terms of representation, which is part of the solution but not sufficient, we do see some improvement.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="7932432">Thank you. The truth hurts sometimes, but thank you to Dr. Penner, Dr. Smith-Carrier and Dina Al-khooly for joining us and for providing excellent testimony.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932433">Thank you to the members for their questions. It's a really good study to be rolling up our sleeves on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932434">There are a couple of housekeeping items before we leave. Should the committee wish to travel during the winter 2024 period, we have a deadline of November 10. If that's desired, think about that and we can discuss further to ensure that we get a detailed budget put together for travel. Maybe we can pick that up next week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932435">Also, the clerk will provide a deadline in the coming weeks for the witness list for the study on indigenous knowledge, so that will be moving forward. Think about whom you can bring to the table on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932436">On Monday, September 25, 2023, we're going to be resuming our studies on both topics we had today. On Monday as well, there's a Support Our Science event in room 306 of the Valour Building from 5:30 to 7 p.m. It starts at 5 p.m., but we'll be in committee until 5:30, so consider that in your planning as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932437">Thank you again to everybody for being part of this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932438">Is it the will of the committee to adjourn? Okay. Thank you.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="7932439">Safe travels. We'll see you next week.</ParaText>
