<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-29,senate" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="National Council for Reconciliation Act" data-intervention-type="Debate" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278514" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. Mark Gerretsen (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.)" data-timestamp="2024-04-19 10:00:00" id="12693094"><p data-HoCid="8336420" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278409" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278409&amp;Language=E">Nepean</a>.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336421" data-originallang="en">Before I begin, I would like to acknowledge that Canada's Parliament is located on the ancestral unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe people.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336422" data-originallang="en">Our collective journey on the path of reconciliation, healing and understanding is not merely a path we choose to walk; it is an essential step toward a better future and an acknowledgement of past wrongs. This is about acknowledging that while we cannot change the past, we have the power and, indeed, the responsibility to shape a better future, which is exactly what Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11893577" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11893577&amp;Language=E">C-29</a>, the piece of legislation we are debating today, is all about. Simply put, it would establish a national council for reconciliation.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336423" data-originallang="en">In 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was chaired by the hon. Murray Sinclair, investigated the history and the legacy of residential schools and released its final report. It came after six years of hearings and testimonies of more than 6,000 residential school survivors and their loved ones. The report included 94 calls to action to address the legacy of residential schools and to achieve true reconciliation based on the experiences and recommendations of survivors. Our government is committed to implementing each and every one of those calls to action.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336424" data-originallang="en">This legislation responds to call to action numbers 53 to 56. The final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission concluded that “all levels of government must make a new commitment to reconciliation and accountability.” The Truth and Reconciliation Commission further noted that Indigenous peoples and Canadians will benefit from the establishment of an oversight body to evaluate and to report on progress made toward fulfilling commitments and to ensure that the necessary educational resources to advance reconciliation are available to all Canadians.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336425" data-originallang="en">On this journey, it is crucial that we listen, truly listen, to the stories of those who have been affected by our history. These stories, though often fraught with pain and injustice, are vital in understanding the depth of the hurt that has been caused. They remind us that behind every call to action, there are human faces and stories that deserve to be heard and to be acknowledged.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336426" data-originallang="en">To that end, this bill was brought forward after extensive engagement with Indigenous peoples and organizations. Our government as well as parliamentarians in both chambers have worked tirelessly to ensure that the bill before us today is at the heart of what indigenous people have been asking for in this country. Parliamentarians have made important amendments, and the government accepts all of them.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336427" data-originallang="en"> Walking the path of reconciliation requires consistent action and a desire to forge a new relationship based on mutual respect, trust and nation-to-nation recognition, to which indigenous peoples are entitled. This work is vital, complex and long term. That is why it is crucial that we have systems to measure the progress we are making as a country as we work toward reconciliation and that we hold the government accountable to its obligations. The council would do just that.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336428" data-originallang="en">Reconciliation requires more than just words. It demands action. It challenges us to move beyond the mere acknowledgement of past injustices to the implementation of concrete steps that address these wrongs. While the<a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="291215" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=291215&amp;Language=E"> Leader of the Opposition</a> offers platitudes on the necessity of reconciliation, there remains a stark contrast between his rhetoric and the actions, or lack thereof, taken by his party.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336429" data-originallang="en">That is why the National Council for Reconciliation is so important. It would be an independent, permanent body that would oversee the progress of reconciliation efforts in Canada. It aims to promote respect, dialogue and understanding between Canadian and indigenous peoples. The council would provide oversight and would hold the government accountable for advancing reconciliation with indigenous communities, including monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336430" data-originallang="en">We know progress has been made, but I hope that everyone in this place would agree that there is more to do. As amended, this bill strengthens the accountability of governments to respond to council concerns in terms of measuring progress. The establishment of such a council reflects a commitment to creating mechanisms for ongoing dialogue, for respect for Indigenous rights and for a concerted effort to address historical injustices and the legacy of colonialism. It signifies a step forward in the journey toward reconciliation, aiming to ensure that the actions and the policies of the future are informed by a comprehensive understanding of the past and present realities faced by indigenous peoples in Canada.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336431" data-originallang="en">I encourage my colleagues to support the bill, as amended, as it represents a critical step toward bridging the gap between words and action.</p>

<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-29,senate" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="National Council for Reconciliation Act" data-intervention-type="Question" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278288" data-person-speaking-attribution="Ms. Leah Gazan (Winnipeg Centre, NDP)" data-timestamp="2024-04-19 10:05:00" id="12693126"><p data-HoCid="8336433" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I do feel that the implementation of the calls to action certainly need oversight because the final report of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation came out in 2015, and the government has barely moved on it.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336434" data-originallang="en">I appreciated the member's comments, particularly about acknowledging history, because we are in a time when there is a rise of residential school denialism. In fact, the Conservative leader, the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278241" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278241&amp;Language=E">Carleton</a>, on the day we were meeting with families searching the landfill, was doing fundraising with a group that puts out articles regularly citing residential school denialism, particularly with unmarked graves.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336435" data-originallang="en">I am wondering what my colleague thinks about a need to put in place legislation to deal with residential school denialism as a form of hate speech.</p>

<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-29,senate" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="National Council for Reconciliation Act" data-intervention-type="Interjection" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278514" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. Mark Gerretsen" data-timestamp="2024-04-19 10:10:00" id="12693128"><p data-HoCid="8336436" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, it is certainly a tough question to answer, in terms of whether legislation is required for that. Unfortunately, we live in a day and age when misinformation is spread so wildly. We do not even seem to have a standard on who is willing to distribute that information in this day and age.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336437" data-originallang="en">At the heart of this is information and making sure that Canadians know exactly what happened. We have a very difficult past to reconcile with. We have the obligation to ensure that we do everything we possibly can. I would even go as far as saying that this is why this legislation is so important. If a council is established permanently, as an act of this Parliament, it becomes much more difficult for a potential future government to dismantle it. Therefore, that council would continue to exist in perpetuity to be able to monitor the progress of the calls to action.</p>

It is par for the course with the NDP team they have.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336439" data-originallang="en">Why were the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, an organization that represents 800 status and non-status, off-reserve, urban indigenous peoples, and the Native Women's Association of Canada not included in this program?</p>

What I do know, as I indicated in my speech, there was an absolute ton of work done in creating this commission and in consulting with indigenous peoples directly. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336441" data-originallang="en">I am a partisan person. I think the Speaker would acknowledge that. When I stand in the House, I am quite partisan. I will take the shots where I see necessary. I really hope that on this particular issue, an issue as important as this, the entire House can support it. We are talking about establishing a council with oversight. I really hope that we can put aside partisanship and that we can move forward in doing what it is right because I know, at heart, every member believes that.</p>

<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-29,senate" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="National Council for Reconciliation Act" data-intervention-type="Question" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278669" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. Luc Desilets (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ)" data-timestamp="2024-04-19 10:10:00" id="12693143"><p data-HoCid="8336442" data-originallang="fr">Madam Speaker, Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11893577" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11893577&amp;Language=E">C-29</a> is fully in line with what the Bloc Québécois has been advocating for a long time, namely the nation-to-nation relationship between indigenous nations, the Quebec nation and the Canadian nation. This resonates perfectly with us. We encourage it and value it enormously. I would just like to mention the agreement reached by Premier Bernard Landry known as Paix des Braves, or peace of the braves. That was a big step for Quebec.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336443" data-originallang="fr">That said, I simply want to take this opportunity to remind the government that there is still a law called the Indian Act. It is 2024. The Indian Act is totally unacceptable, unfair and discriminatory. I would like to know what my colleague thinks about that.</p>

I completely agree that, with respect to having an act with that name in 2024, we should be moving in the direction of replacing it and probably updating legislation in the process.</p>

<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-29,senate" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="National Council for Reconciliation Act" data-intervention-type="Question" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278409" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. Chandra Arya (Nepean, Lib.)" data-timestamp="2024-04-19 10:15:00" id="12693148"><p data-HoCid="8336445" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on the legislation that provides for the establishment of a national council for reconciliation. It would be an independent, non-political, permanent and indigenous-led organization with a purpose to advance efforts for reconciliation with indigenous peoples. This council would track our progress on implementing the calls to action, a road map for reconciliation. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336446" data-originallang="en">I wish to reiterate that we are committed to implementing the calls to action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, advancing reconciliation and working in partnership with first nations, Inuit and Métis. We will implement all the calls to action and advance reconciliation in partnership with first nations, Inuit and Métis. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336447" data-originallang="en">We recognize the crucial role played by the Senate of Canada, which is often referred to as the chamber of sober second thought. This body serves as a vital check on the legislative process, ensuring that laws enacted by the House of Commons receive thorough review and consideration. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336448" data-originallang="en">The Senate's recent amendments to a key piece of legislation exemplify its essential function. By refining terms, clarifying language and specifying functions, the Senate has enhanced not only the clarity of the law but also its effectiveness in serving the diverse needs of Canadians, particularly emphasizing respect and precision in matters involving indigenous governing bodies. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336449" data-originallang="en">The amendments, such as the explicit use of the terms “first nations”, “Inuit” and “Métis” in the preamble, focus on inclusivity and the acknowledgement of Canada's indigenous peoples. They also improve governance by defining the scope and functions of the new council and by ensuring transparency with the tabling of an annual report. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336450" data-originallang="en">These adjustments are crucial for meaningful consultation and co-operation with indigenous communities. Let us value and respect the Senate's diligent work. Its amendments contribute significantly to making legislation more just, more precise and better suited to serving our society's needs. The Senate's thoughtful revisions ensure our laws reflect the voices and rights of all Canadians. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336451" data-originallang="en">Indigenous peoples in Canada, comprising first nations, Métis and Inuit communities, represent diverse and vibrant cultures with distinct traditions, languages and histories. Today these groups face a complex set of challenges and opportunities. Socially and economically, indigenous people often experience higher rates of poverty, lower educational attainment, health disparities and limited access to essential services compared with non-indigenous Canadians. These issues are rooted in historical injustices, such as colonization and the residential school system. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336452" data-originallang="en">However, there is ongoing progress in addressing these challenges. Recent years have seen increased governmental and public recognition of indigenous rights and sovereignty. Efforts towards reconciliation are evident in initiatives such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action, which aim to rectify historical wrongs. Indigenous political and cultural resurgence is also notable, with indigenous leaders playing key roles in national dialogues about environmental protection, economic development and cultural preservation. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336453" data-originallang="en">We can imagine a Canada where the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action are fully realized, a nation defined by understanding, justice and mutual respect. The impact of implementing these calls is profound, promising a future where all Canadians, including first nations, Métis and Inuit, share equally in the prosperity and cultural richness of our country. By acknowledging and correcting the historical and systemic injustices faced by indigenous peoples, we foster a national spirit of genuine reconciliation. This means not only recognizing past wrongs but also actively working to rectify them. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336454" data-originallang="en">Education systems would teach the true history of indigenous peoples, fostering understanding and respect from a young age. Meanwhile, health and justice systems would be reformed to eliminate systemic biases, ensuring that indigenous communities receive equitable treatment. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336455" data-originallang="en">The economic impact would be significant as well. By supporting indigenous businesses and integrating traditional knowledge into our economic practices, we unlock new opportunities for innovation and sustainability. Socially, as barriers are dismantled, we would see stronger, more inclusive communities across Canada, enriched by the diverse cultures and traditions of indigenous peoples. This is an investment in the future not only of indigenous communities but of all Canadians, creating a society that truly reflects our values of fairness and equality.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336456" data-originallang="en">These are the reasons I stand here to discuss the imperative of fully implementing the calls to action of Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336457" data-originallang="en">This comprehensive report is not merely a document. It is a blueprint for healing and partnership, aimed at righting the historical injustices faced by indigenous peoples in Canada.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336458" data-originallang="en">For too long, the voices of first nations, Métis and Inuit communities have been marginalized. The residential school system stripped away language, culture and identity and stands as a dark chapter in our national history. The calls to action provide us with a path to acknowledge these painful truths, to learn from them and to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336459" data-originallang="en">Implementing these calls to action is not just a moral obligation but also a vital step towards building a just society in which the rights and cultures of indigenous peoples are respected. It is about creating educational programs that reflect the true history of Canada, reforming the justice system to be equitable and ensuring that health and child welfare services meet the needs of indigenous communities.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336460" data-originallang="en">Let us embrace this opportunity to foster reconciliation, to build bridges and to work hand in hand with indigenous communities toward a shared and equitable future. The path is laid out before us. It is time for action, commitment and perseverance. Let us move forward together, not as separate entities but as united Canadians, honouring every chapter of our shared history.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336461" data-originallang="en">The council, as outlined in Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11893577" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11893577&amp;Language=E">C-29</a>, would be an independent, non-partisan body dedicated to overseeing the ongoing efforts towards reconciliation.

	<p data-HoCid="8336466" data-originallang="en">Notably, the board of directors, primarily composed of indigenous members, will include representatives nominated by major indigenous organizations, ensuring a broad and inclusive range of voices in guiding the council’s mission. This legislation empowers the council to monitor and evaluate our nation's progress in addressing the calls to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</p>

By incorporating the council under the Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act, we would also ensure that it has a solid structural and legal foundation to operate effectively and independently.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336468" data-originallang="en">The path to reconciliation is long and challenging. However, with the establishment of the national council for reconciliation, we would reaffirm our commitment to a just and equitable future. Let us move forward together, with renewed dedication and hope.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336469" data-originallang="en">In the coming years, the status of indigenous peoples in Canada is anticipated to reflect significant advancements in reconciliation and self-determination. Building on current trends, there will likely be greater acknowledgement and implementation of indigenous rights, with increased political representation and leadership across various sectors.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="8336478" data-originallang="en">The budget just came out. There is no mention of indigenous people, and the Liberals actually put more money into auto theft than they did into the MMIWG crisis. It sends a very clear message, as I pointed out to the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="263831" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=263831&amp;Language=E">minister</a>, that Canada cares more about finding cars than it does about finding indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ individuals. That does not look like reconciliation to me.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336479" data-originallang="en">I would also point out there are more kids in care now than at the height of residential schools, partly because of ongoing systemic racism, which has been reported.

	<p data-HoCid="8336493" data-originallang="en">What does the word “reconciliation” mean? After nine years of the current government, what we have seen is that it has become a buzzword. Reconciliation is about walking shoulder to shoulder, listening, learning and being open to admitting that wrongs were done.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336494" data-originallang="en">Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11893577" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11893577&amp;Language=E">C-29</a> is a response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action 53 to 56. I will remind the House that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was founded by our former prime minister, Stephen Harper, in the former Conservative government. Throughout these conversations, there is always finger pointing that goes on, but I would hazard that there is enough blame to go around on all sides.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336495" data-originallang="en"> We have seen, in the last nine years, the government picking winners and losers, pitting first nations against first nations, first nations against non-first nations, Métis against Métis, and Métis against non-Métis. We have seen our <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a> thank indigenous protesters who were simply protesting the fact that the boil water advisories in their communities are ongoing. What did he do when he was at his fancy function? He thanked them for their donation. We have seen him cast away the first indigenous female Attorney General, Jody Wilson-Raybould. She spoke truth to power and was cast aside.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336496" data-originallang="en"> We have seen the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a> stand there with his hand on his heart, dabbing away a fake tear with a tissue, saying that this is his most important relationship. However, as we just heard, the government has launched its ninth budget without any mention of reconciliation for indigenous peoples, so members will have to pardon me if I seem a bit skeptical about what the government is planning with Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11893577" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11893577&amp;Language=E">C-29</a>.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336497" data-originallang="en">Over the time of my being elected, whether with my current file on mental health and suicide prevention or my previous files on transportation or fisheries, the government likes to say that it has consulted. However, is it truly consultation and engagement, or is it merely putting a checkmark in a box on a sheet that says what they had to do and complete? True engagement means sitting at the table and fully understanding all sides.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336498" data-originallang="en">What has brought us to this point? In recent years, we heard about the horrors of the residential school program, but the world is just waking up to what some of us have been hearing for many years. The residential school program was designed to drive the Indian out of the children, and thousands upon thousands of first nations, Inuit and Métis children were taken from their homes and never returned.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336499" data-originallang="en">Sitting with residential school survivors and listening to their stories is horrible. The start of the ground sonar search in my riding of Cariboo—Prince George was at the former St. Joseph's Mission Residential School in my hometown of Williams Lake. I am on record saying that I grew up just down the road from this school, yet I had no idea of the horrors that were going on at that school.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336500" data-originallang="en">These were kids that I played with. I know many of them to this day. They are my friends and family. My family is first nations as well. Watching a residential school survivor come to the lands for a ceremony marking the start of the ground sonar search and watching them shake and become so emotional as those memories come flooding back is absolutely heartbreaking.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336501" data-originallang="en">In nine years of the government, it has only fully implemented 11 of the 94 calls to action, and only eight of the 76 calls that are the federal government's responsibility. Why did it take four years for the Liberals to implement this after the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a> made the announcement about it in 2018? Why are they still not bringing in or listening to all of the indigenous groups that want to be a part of this?</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336502" data-originallang="en">There is the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, an organization that represents over 800 status and non-status, off-reserve, urban indigenous peoples, and the Native Women's Association of Canada, an organization that represents women and children on and off reserve. At committee, our Conservative team, the Bloc and NDP members passed a motion to include these two national organizations. However, when the rubber hit the road, when it came time to make sure they were part of it, our NDP colleagues sided with their Liberal friends and voted to exclude the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, effectively silencing the voices of 800,000 off-reserve indigenous peoples. Why?</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336503" data-originallang="en">Reconciliation is about inclusion. Reconciliation is about recognizing economic prosperity, allowing indigenous individuals and communities to recognize their full potential. It is unbelievable that we are still debating this bill. The fact that this bill is still here, the fact that we are still in the process of debating it after having numerous amendments and speeches, speaks to the government's failure to meaningfully consult and advance this issue.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336504" data-originallang="en">Now the Liberals are going to stand up and I guarantee that at one point we are going to hear that the bill has been blocked and there have been lots of dilatory motions from this side, but they have the majority. If the Liberals want to push something through, with their NDP colleagues they can push it through.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336505" data-originallang="en">Our Conservative colleagues worked diligently at the committee to improve the bill. Is that not the message we always give? Just let it pass, let it get to committee and we will make it better there. However, again, we have heard that they blocked and left out two important groups.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336506" data-originallang="en">The Liberals talk about consultation. Does Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11893577" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11893577&amp;Language=E">C-29</a> truly represent the work and consultation they have done? Does it truly represent all the indigenous people, or does it just simply reflect the views of those who are friends of the Liberal government?</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336507" data-originallang="en">We know that recently there are about 113 indigenous groups in Ontario that are taking the federal government to court over boil water advisories. The government talks a good game, but the truth is in its actions. As important as the bill is, it also highlights the failure of the Liberal government to listen to Canadians, to listen meaningfully and to consult with indigenous peoples.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336508" data-originallang="en">This is, of course, not the first time we have spoken about the Liberals' inability to consult and listen. They always seem to go down the path of just ticking the boxes of the groups that are in agreement with them. They use that as their record of consultation, yet they have left a whole community of indigenous peoples out when it pertains to Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11893577" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11893577&amp;Language=E">C-29</a>.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336509" data-originallang="en">A concern we have is that, time and again, we see these bills that come forth, and they are not perfect, and then the consequences are faced afterwards. We will hear comments from the other side, saying that we should never let perfection get in the way of getting something done.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336510" data-originallang="en">I have talked about winners and losers with the government. I have talked about my friend Chief Willie Sellars in Williams Lake. He is the chief of his community who, in all senses of the word, is leading by example. He is not waiting for the government to provide handouts. He has done everything to lead his nation and his community to economic prosperity.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336511" data-originallang="en">Ellis Ross, a provincial MLA in British Columbia, walks the walk. I remember sitting at a presentation with him about 10 years ago, and he said that we do not need all these fancy words and we don't need to listen to an unelected group, the United Nations, with the calls to action. What we need, he said, is the government to get out of the way, to allow us to chart our own path forward.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336512" data-originallang="en">Is this council going to be just another arm of the minister of the day? These are the questions we have. Will the government even listen to the national council? It has spent the last nine years over-promising and under-delivering on indigenous issues. How many communities still have the boil water advisories? It is unbelievable.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336513" data-originallang="en">I remember the speeches we did in the House during one of the first emergency debates we had. It was on the suicide epidemic on Attawapiskat First Nation. It was heartbreaking for me to hear the stories we were hearing.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336514" data-originallang="en">Sadly, I ask if things have gotten better for indigenous peoples in the last nine years under the current government. In 2015, the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a> stood and promised that this was his most important relationship.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336515" data-originallang="en">It is complex, I will give the Liberals that, but if this was truly the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a>'s most important relationship, why have they just announced so much spending in a budget in which we would spend more money servicing our debt than we do on health care? When the books were open, the safe was open, and they were throwing money at everything, yet there was not a mention of indigenous peoples or reconciliation. It is frustrating. What would be measured with this council? What gets measured, gets done.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336516" data-originallang="en">Conservatives will be supporting this bill because we believe in the premise that we have to have everyone around the table. True reconciliation begins with understanding and, as I said earlier, listening with open hearts, open ears and open eyes. My concern with the government is that this is just here to placate. There is no real meaning or value behind doing this.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336517" data-originallang="en">It is frustrating, as I already said earlier in my speech, that we are debating this today, when it could have been done previously. It has been nine years. </p>

	<p data-HoCid="8336598" data-originallang="en">Throughout her career, Elise elevated positive Black history in Canada, earning many accolades including the Order of Ontario designation, being named among the 100 Accomplished Black Canadian Women, and receiving the Ontario Black History Society's Daniel Hill Award, the Ontario Museum Association's Award of Excellence, Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Medal and the Ontario Historical Society's Carnochan Award.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336599" data-originallang="en">For over 60 years, Elise has highlighted how African Canadians were essential to Canada's development and was the first Black female curator at the Amherstburg Freedom Museum.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336600" data-originallang="en">Elise comes from a family of strong character. Her late sister, Shelley Harding-Smith, was Canada's first Black female master electrician and an activist, and was a friend and a mentor to me, personally. Their great-grandfather was a slave, and both Elise and Shelley progressed in a challenging world, where they let nothing stand in their way.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336601" data-originallang="en">August 1 this year will mark the 190th anniversary of Emancipation Day, marking the day Canada's Slavery Abolition Act came into effect. Canada still needs to apologize for the enslavement of Black Canadians. An official apology would mean a lifetime of work recognized.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336602" data-originallang="en">Elise exemplifies the true meaning of preserving Black history in Canada. Her legacy will no doubt inspire future generations.</p>

It is a day to raise awareness of environmental and climate issues. Let us remember a few facts. July 2023 was the hottest month in human history. Last month was the 18th consecutive month to set a heat record. Here in Quebec and Canada, unprecedented wildfires ravaged our forests and made the air in our cities the most polluted in the world last summer. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336604" data-originallang="fr">We are in the midst of a climate emergency and Canada's slowness in moving away from oil is a millstone around our neck. In that sense, anyone who calls themselves an environmentalist should support Quebec's independence. With our clean energy, we would finally be free to become an example to follow. We might even inspire our neighbour, Canada. As a woman who cares about our climate security and as a sovereignist, I am convinced that Quebec becoming a country would be good for everyone.</p>

One chicken farmer in the Shuswap paid over $100,000 last year alone, just for his carbon tax bill.

Specifically, four items are noted in the petition: first, chattel enslavement was initiated over 400 years ago to assemble a cheap, ready and usable workforce that was dehumanized and dispersed globally; second, in colonial Canada, King Louis XIV's Code Noir became law in 1743 and required both indigenous and Black slaves brought into the French colony to be considered the possessions of those who purchased them; third, Great Britain further supported the practice of chattel enslavement after the French in 1759; and fourth, following the Slavery Abolition Act of 1834, and after the Dominion of Canada was created in 1867, systemic racism continued, thereby perpetuating the practice of discriminating beliefs in societal institutions, organizations and legislation, which treated Black people as marginal and inferior.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336845" data-originallang="en">Therefore, these petitioners are calling on the Government of Canada to finally do the right thing and apologize to Black Canadians for the centuries of mistreatment and racism in Canada.

This is despite the fact that the Calgary Co-op states that its bags contain no plastic, including no plastic in the ink, and that those non-plastic bags are engineered to break down at the local composting facility that the City of Calgary owns within a 28-day time frame. There is no waste and no plastic.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336865" data-originallang="en">The Calgary Co-op says that its bags are truly popular with its members and are often reused as bin liners for household organic waste, constituting a second use.

<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-29,senate" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="National Council for Reconciliation Act" data-intervention-type="Question" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278640" data-person-speaking-attribution="Ms. Niki Ashton (Churchill—Keewatinook Aski, NDP)" data-timestamp="2024-04-19 12:25:00" id="12693733"><p data-HoCid="8336871" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11893577" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11893577&amp;Language=E">C-29</a>, an act to provide for the establishment of a national council for reconciliation. If enacted, this would ensure a non-partisan, arm's-length organization that would hold the government of the day to its commitments to reconciliation. This is needed, because the government shows less of a commitment to reconciliation every year. Let us look at the Liberal record.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336872" data-originallang="en">Last year, not one Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommendation was implemented. Out of the 94 calls to action, only 13 have been accomplished. The government promised to end long-term boil water advisories more than three years ago, but there is still no end in sight. This year is looking even worse.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336873" data-originallang="en">What has happened with the government’s most important relationship, we might ask? We can just look at this past week. The <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="263831" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=263831&amp;Language=E">Minister of Finance</a> could not even bring herself to utter the word “indigenous” or “reconciliation” in her speech introducing the budget. However, given her rhetoric over the last year, why would she?</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336874" data-originallang="en">Indigenous peoples spent months hearing the government threaten sunsetting and cuts to the services that they and their communities rely on. Programs, services and grants that people rely on were threatened, including Jordan’s principle and dealing with the harmful legacy of residential schools. It took NDP pressure to reverse many of those cuts.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336875" data-originallang="en">This is how low the bar is set with the government, opposing cuts in the face of a $350-billion infrastructure gap. Instead of proposing a wealth tax or an excess profit tax on people such as Mirko Bibic, Galen Weston or Arthur Irving, the government consciously chose to spend less than 1% of what is needed to end the housing crisis on first nations.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336876" data-originallang="en">Despite all their bluster, big oil does not need to beg the government for handouts. Galen Weston certainly does not. Bell gets all the money it needs to give away in fat bonuses and shareholder dividends while laying off thousands of workers. However, first nations are treated as an afterthought in this budget. It really boggles the mind.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336877" data-originallang="en"> The government recently co-authored a report that made clear how badly federal governments, whether Liberal or Conservative, have just fundamentally failed first nations. If one doubled the number of homes in first nations communities, the report said, there would still not be enough to meet the housing demand. Upon releasing the report with the AFN, the Liberals decided to completely ignore it. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336878" data-originallang="en">The Liberals know that they will not hit the 2030 goal to end the housing crisis for first nations. Their department officials have admitted as much, but the Liberal MPs will not admit it, nor will the ministers responsible or the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a>.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336879" data-originallang="en">Communities such as the ones here in northern Manitoba live this reality every day. They know it well. That is why Grand Chief Cathy Merrick said, in response to this budget, that it will be a cold day in hell before the infrastructure gap facing first nations is ended. That is why the AFN National Chief Woodhouse Nepinak is calling for a first ministers meeting this year to discuss a path forward on reconciliation, because the government is just not getting the work done.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336880" data-originallang="en"> Let us be honest about what a $350-billion infrastructure gap looks like. There is Shamattawa First Nation, where the housing crisis is so bad, the community has had to deal with tuberculosis outbreaks. In fact, here in northern Manitoba, over the last number of years, we have had higher rates of tuberculosis than have some parts of sub-Saharan Africa. There is Tataskweyak Cree Nation, where the government so fundamentally failed in delivering clean water that it had to fight the first nation in court.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336881" data-originallang="en">There is Pimicikamak Cree Nation, which has a 2,000-family wait-list for homes. There is also the Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation, which has a 700-family wait-list for homes.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336882" data-originallang="en">There is Wasagamack, one of the most isolated communities in the country. It is still waiting for the federal government to step up and work with the community and the province to build a desperately needed airport.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336883" data-originallang="en">Communities on the east side of Manitoba, on the east side of Lake Winnipeg, are paying the price for climate change. They have no choice but to rely on ice roads, which are increasingly unreliable because of the shortened winter season. They have made it clear to the federal government that they need all-weather roads but the federal government has made no commitment to working with them to help build the roads. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336884" data-originallang="en">There is the Island Lake region, where the population is similar to that of my hometown of Thompson. Thousands of people live in the region; they still do not have a hospital or an all-weather road. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336885" data-originallang="en">The housing infrastructure gap, which I would call a crisis, is pervasive in first nations here in Manitoba and for many first nations across the country. Communities need housing, elders' care homes, day cares, health centres, water treatment plants and emergency preparedness-related infrastructure. They need to improve existing roads and build new ones so they can fight to survive climate change.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336886" data-originallang="en">Many of these stories are rooted here in my constituency in northern Manitoba, on the east side of Lake Winnipeg, but we know they are repeated across the country. Indigenous peoples are almost three times more likely to live in a home in need of major repair. More than half of first nations do not have regular access to high-speed Internet, and roughly 15% have none at all.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336887" data-originallang="en">We need to be honest with ourselves. This is keeping indigenous communities poor, and it is a choice by the federal government. Every time the government looks the other way on a tax loophole, every time we buy fridges for Galen Weston or give billions of dollars to big oil, that is money we are not spending on the people and communities most in need. The sad reality is that the government only steps up when it is court-ordered to do so. In fact, budget 2024 outlined $57 billion in settlement money, as if it were a huge success by the government and not a situation where it fought first nations, Inuit and Métis people every step of the way to deny them justice.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336888" data-originallang="en">To be honest, it is clear that the government is laying the groundwork for future class-action lawsuits against it. One can only imagine what is coming on the housing front. The Auditor General recently released a report on the housing crisis on reserve, and it came out that Indigenous Services has been using the wrong census data, data from 2001. This has effectively robbed first nations, particularly in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, of the housing dollars they deserve, for up to a quarter of a billion dollars.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336889" data-originallang="en">Did the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278911" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278911&amp;Language=E">Minister of Indigenous Services</a> or the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a> rush to right that wrong, to get that money into the hands of communities that had a right to it? No, when he was asked about it, the Prime Minister instead refused to even entertain the idea that they ever would. That is another example of the government fundamentally failing first nations and one that will likely end in a class-action lawsuit, something it deeply deserves.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336890" data-originallang="en">In contrast, we have a Conservative Party that never saw a tax break for billionaires it did not love. The last time the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="291215" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=291215&amp;Language=E">leader of the official opposition</a> was in government, the Conservatives gave away $60 billion in corporate tax cuts. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336891" data-originallang="en">On the day the previous prime minister delivered a public apology to survivors of residential schools, years ago, the current Conservative leader, the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="291215" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=291215&amp;Language=E">leader of the official opposition</a>, said that he was not sure Canada was “getting value for all of this money”. It was money being spent to compensate survivors, and his view was that “we need to engender the values of hard work and independence and self-reliance. That's the solution in the long run—more money will not solve it”.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336892" data-originallang="en">I challenge the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="291215" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=291215&amp;Language=E">leader of the official opposition</a> to come to first nations like the ones I represent, where kids were abused, where kids died and where families are still dealing with the poisonous and destructive legacy of the residential school system. I challenge the leader of the official opposition to look people in the face and to say that Canada is the victim here and that Canada is the one that did not get its value. Shame on him.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336893" data-originallang="en">However, it is not just him who does not understand the harmful legacy of residential schools. The reality is that we are now approaching three years since Canadians learned what first nations across the country already knew: the existence of mass grave sites near residential schools. However, the government is still not supporting communities with the resources they need to bring their children home.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336894" data-originallang="en">Communities like Cross Lake and others wanted to work with the International Commission on Missing Persons. The work has already begun. However, before it could move forward, the government ended the contract, and now Cross Lake and other communities are forced to start over; it is justice delayed.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336895" data-originallang="en">Despite his claims that he wants to support communities, the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="299998" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=299998&amp;Language=E">Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations</a> has done virtually nothing to assist first nations that want to work with the ICMP, a global leader when it comes to uncovering mass graves. He has done virtually nothing to assist first nations that desperately want to work to uncover the truth and to bring their children home.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336896" data-originallang="en">In Sagkeeng First Nation, an employee recently found bones while digging a trench for a water pipe to a church addition. The area was not part of any known cemetery. The community wants to work with the International Commission on Missing Persons. They have asked CIRNAC for support, but have not received any.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336897" data-originallang="en">People across our north see through the government's empty use of the word “reconciliation”. People across our north want to see action. The NDP will continue to call out the government when it fails indigenous peoples and when it talks a good talk, especially on reconciliation, while refusing to follow through in terms of action. We are proud to support this bill, Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11893577" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11893577&amp;Language=E">C-29</a>, but recognize that the monitoring process, or lack thereof, will not create the change indigenous peoples need to see.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336898" data-originallang="en">Here, in our part of the country, people are clear. Indigenous leaders, elders, youth and advocates are clear that what they need to see is action: an end to third-world living conditions, true change in the face of the climate emergency, and real investment to make life better. They deserve action. They deserve justice, and we should recognize and act on nothing less.</p>

I believe it is a commitment that is being fulfilled as one of the 94 calls for action.

As well, there is the fact that less than 1% of what is needed was invested in first nations housing and infrastructure, given that the recently uncovered $350-billion gap is nothing to write home about.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336903" data-originallang="en">I know this member is from Manitoba, and he knows well the infrastructure gap first nations face.

	<p data-HoCid="8336905" data-originallang="en">I want to build on what the member was saying about how the word indigenous was not even mentioned once by the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="263831" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=263831&amp;Language=E">finance minister</a>. The fact that the government gave more money to deal with auto theft in this budget than it did to finding murdered and missing indigenous women and girls is sending a very clear message to indigenous people that it values cars more than it values us. That is how crass the government has been. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336906" data-originallang="en">We know we are billions of dollars short to deal with the housing gap. We know there continues to be boil water advisories. However, I want to speak specifically about the north. We are in the middle of a climate emergency.

It is a stark condemnation of a Liberal plan to act on the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women, as well as the fact that there is more money available for stolen cars than there is for action on missing and murdered indigenous women in this budget. It is absolutely shocking.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336909" data-originallang="en">To the question on the climate emergency, we are on day two of what we refer to as “snowmagedden” here in northern Manitoba. We have had record snowfall, the likes of which we have never seen before at this time of year. The overall message has been that communities do not have the capacity to deal with what climate change is bringing, whether it is historic wildfires, historic flooding and this kind of precipitation.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336910" data-originallang="en">First nations are clear on the kinds of infrastructure investments they need to prepare in the face of climate change and mitigate the devastating impacts. Frankly, the only party that does not seem to get it is the federal government, which continues to ignore calls to work on the airport in Wasagamack, calls to invest in all-weather road infrastructure and calls to invest in emergency preparedness related to infrastructure. People are bracing themselves for what the summer will bring. The bottom line is that we need the federal government to step up and work with first nations now.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="8336912" data-originallang="en"> I wonder if the member could share her thoughts on what will happen because of the budget announcement. Even if this bill were to pass, what would happen with indigenous peoples once we start seeing commitments rather than inaction?</p>

I am so honoured to work alongside her and our incredible team.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336914" data-originallang="en">The budget is a huge disappointment for indigenous communities. Indigenous national and regional leaders have been very clear that it misses the mark in so many ways. I will say that I am proud of the work that the NDP did to fight back against a number of the cuts that were proposed, but let us not kid ourselves. The less than 1% funding on housing and infrastructure is a serious failure on the part of the Liberal government. It continues the legacy of Liberal underfunding that we saw under Paul Martin and have seen time and time again from the Liberals and, of course, the Conservatives.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336915" data-originallang="en">Third world living conditions in indigenous communities did not just happen. They are the result of chronic underfunding and of choices that Liberal and Conservative governments have made to prioritize their rich and powerful friends, rather than investing and working with indigenous communities to make the difference that they deserve and that, I would say, Canada is obligated to make as well.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="8336933" data-originallang="en">It is one of the planks the Conservative Party's members talk about. If we remember, there are four things that they talk about, saying these are the things they would do if they were, heaven forbid, to form government. One of them is to abolish crime. I am not too sure exactly how they are going to abolish crime. I think they have some sort of wand or, through legislation, they are going to make it illegal to commit a crime and, therefore, if it is illegal to commit a crime, crime will go away. I suspect that is what they are thinking.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336934" data-originallang="en">I say that somewhat sarcastically, but when I look at this bill, it reinforces the need to maybe chastise the Conservatives and their approach in terms of how they like to say one thing when they are in opposition and do something else when they are in government. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336935" data-originallang="en">I was surprised when going over the summary. I would ask my friends across the way to follow along. I am sure they would agree with me that there is quite a bit of hypocrisy they might be witnessing first-hand. I will read the summary of the bill. It states that Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="12566649" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=12566649&amp;Language=E">C-351</a> seeks to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act to require that inmates who have been designated as dangerous offenders or convicted of more than one count of first-degree murder be classified as a maximum-security offender and be confined, and this is the really important part, in maximum security by Correctional Service Canada.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336936" data-originallang="en">There are many thoughts that come to my mind regarding what is being proposed. I could talk about the technicalities of trusting the people in place who are professionally trained individuals and have done a fairly incredible job in our jails, correctional facilities and so forth, and of having more faith in them. I could comment on that, but, rather, I want to point out and expand upon the comments I made about the hypocrisy issue. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336937" data-originallang="en">Many members will recall the horrific brutality of the killing of Tori Stafford and the abuse and murder that ultimately took place. In fact, it was not that long ago when we heard a regurgitation of it by a number of Conservative members of Parliament, who were raising the issue in fairly graphic detail at times. They were doing that because Terri-Lynne McClintic was transferred to a healing lodge. The Conservative Party was absolutely outraged because that had taken place.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336938" data-originallang="en">A number of Conservatives took it upon themselves, as I said, to graphically explain what happened to the victim, somewhat referring to the family. Even to this day, I extend my most sincere condolences to them in recognizing the horrific actions that took place. The family and the community are still living with that tragedy.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336939" data-originallang="en">Having said that, we were soundly criticized. I believe Ralph Goodale was minister of public safety at the time and he was being criticized because of this transfer. I remember it quite well because it was being debated and I commented on the issue. As the debate went on, one of the things we found out was that it was actually Stephen Harper's government that saw Terri-Lynne McClintic transferred out of a high-security prison into a medium-security prison, which enabled her to be transferred to the healing lodge.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336940" data-originallang="en">With a little more research, what can be found is that this is not the first person. When the Conservative Party was in power, we saw a mass murderer actually being transferred out of high-security into medium-security prison. Now we have a private member's bill that is against what Stephen Harper and his government did. They allowed the professionals, the individuals charged with the responsibility for issues such as jail conditions, the type of incarceration and so forth, to make the decisions. Stephen Harper did what was expected of him as prime minister.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336941" data-originallang="en">Where were the Conservative voices back then? The <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="291215" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=291215&amp;Language=E">leader of the Conservative Party</a> was actually in Stephen Harper's cabinet. I am sure members could appreciate why I am a little skeptical of how the Conservatives are now taking the position that they want high security and that it is absolutely mandatory.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336942" data-originallang="en">At the end of the day, it is all about the votes for the Conservative Party. It is not about the issues, and they have demonstrated that. It is interesting. The Conservatives recently started talking about auto thefts. Now they are being critical of the government, and we have taken tangible actions on that.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336943" data-originallang="en">I think back to 2007-08, although I might be off by a year or two, when I was in the provincial legislature in Manitoba. The prime minister was Stephen Harper, and today's <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="291215" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=291215&amp;Language=E">leader of the Conservative Party</a> was with him. At that time, no province in the country had more auto theft than the province of Manitoba did, and it was by a long shot. This was not even on a per capita basis. On a per capita basis, it would have been an astronomical difference. We had a serious issue.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336944" data-originallang="en">What got Manitoba back on the right track was when law enforcement, the federal government and the province came together to come up with a solution to deal with auto theft in the province of Manitoba. It was very effective once it really got going.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336945" data-originallang="en">One should not quote me on the numbers, but we are talking about thousands of vehicles. If we look at Manitoba, with a population base of under 1.2 million back then, and Ontario, with 14 million-plus people, we still had more vehicles being stolen. It took the governments coming together to make a difference. That is what we are seeing with Ontario and Quebec in trying to deal with this very serious issue.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336946" data-originallang="en">Therein lies the difference between the Conservatives and the Liberals. As a government, we are prepared to work with other jurisdictions in order to have their backs and support Canadians in whatever way we can. We can contrast that with the Conservatives, who are more interested in bumper stickers than they are in resolving problems. That is how I see Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="12566649" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=12566649&amp;Language=E">C-351</a>, which is actually a flip-flop on the position Conservatives held when they were in government and Stephen Harper was the prime minister.</p>

I followed the saga surrounding the transfer of inmate Paul Bernardo from a maximum-security penitentiary to the medium-security facility in La Macaza, because the La Macaza institution is located in my riding of Laurentides—Labelle.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336948" data-originallang="fr">On March 27, at the invitation of the Union of Canadian Correctional Officers , I spent the day inside the institution. What I heard that day had absolutely nothing to do with the inmate in question. We agree that his crimes are revolting, but quite honestly, we are not concerned about his transfer to that facility. What revolts us is what is happening inside the walls of this institution. The correctional officers told me about some things that I want to share. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336949" data-originallang="fr">They told me about the delivery of drugs by drone, faulty and outdated equipment and staff retention issues. They told me about shivs, physical assaults on employees and the list goes on. I spent the day there. Rather than addressing the real problems in federal penitentiaries, since it is not just at the La Macaza facility that we need to take action to ensure the safety of staff who work every day to keep the public safe, the Conservative Party has introduced a populist, sensationalist bill.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336950" data-originallang="fr">That is not taking care of people. When a party aspires to form the government, its absolute priority should be to take care of people. Instead, the Conservatives want to instill fear in everyone by making up problems where there are none. The member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278564" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278564&amp;Language=E">Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo</a> came to La Macaza in early February for a photo op. Unfortunately for him, some of the facts were wrong.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336951" data-originallang="fr">When I went there, it was not to engage in self-promotion. I was there to get input from the correctional officers and all the employees who work to ensure public safety. I was there to understand their reality, to understand what happens behind the walls, to understand this universe that is completely foreign to me, but is important to grasp in order to avoid coming to hasty conclusions and to have a better sense of this critical problem in our democratic society.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336952" data-originallang="fr">The Bloc Québécois has always stood up for victims. My colleague from <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278276" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278276&amp;Language=E">Rivière-du-Nord</a>, who has already spoken about this bill, had this to say:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="8336953" data-originallang="fr"> I can assure him that the Bloc Québécois [also sides with the victims]. It always has and always will side with victims. The Bloc also sides with society. We must never lose sight of the fact that our justice system is not just about avenging a victim or punishing a criminal. The purpose of our justice system is to build a safer society... </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8336954" data-originallang="fr">I can say that I am quite partisan about what comes next. As I often say, in a mature, democratically evolved society where the rule of law is a fundamental value, we cannot accept even the slightest encroachment of politics into the judiciary. To me, that is key.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336955" data-originallang="fr">In his work <em>The Spirit of Law</em>, Montesquieu outlines his theory of the separation of powers. He states that, in order to avoid despotism, it is absolutely essential to separate the legislative, executive and judicial powers. This bill is nothing less than a proposal to reverse that sacrosanct separation. The Government of Canada, regardless of its colour, whether it is red, blue or potentially orange, may well seize arbitrary powers for itself, but when it comes to judicial powers, politics should not play a part.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336956" data-originallang="fr">The independence of Correctional Service Canada's and the Parole Board of Canada's decisions about incarcerated individuals, including assigning and changing their respective security classification, stems from the quasi-judicial nature that the law confers on them. Even if these two organizations are attached to the government apparatus, they are effectively equipped with an administrative tribunal that must make decisions independently. I like that word. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336957" data-originallang="fr">The Conservatives are proposing to remove that independence from bodies that make decisions based on objective and impartial criteria. The fact is, that worries me. We need to have governments that respect the independence of government agencies. We saw that the Harper government often trampled on that independence. We see that the Conservative Party wants to go down that road again. That does not bode well for the future. On one hand, we have the Liberal Party that interferes in provincial jurisdictions. On the other hand, we have the Conservative Party that wants to interfere in the independence of government organizations. I believe that is going too far, and it does not bode well.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336958" data-originallang="fr">I will wrap up my speech. The bill introduced by the Conservative member from <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278438" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278438&amp;Language=E">Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup</a> is a complete departure from the principle whereby these offenders can be on a path to rehabilitation.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336959" data-originallang="fr">In our society, we do not want penitentiaries to become factories to turn out criminals. Yes, we want them to be places where people are detained, but we also want them to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation. In our society, we want the separation of powers to be respected. We want human rights to be respected. We want those who have demonstrated a willingness to reintegrate into society to have a second chance and to turn their lives around, when possible. We want governments that respect everyone's jurisdictions.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336960" data-originallang="fr">That is the society that we will build when Quebec becomes a country.</p>
	</div>
<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-351,2" data-h1="Private Members' Business" data-h2="Corrections and Conditional Release Act" data-intervention-type="Question" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278613" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. Matthew Green (Hamilton Centre, NDP)" data-timestamp="2024-04-19 13:10:00" id="12693836"><p data-HoCid="8336961" data-originallang="en">Madam Speaker, certainly ending the week by debating the bill before us provides a certain level of weight for anybody who is recounting the atrocities and the sensationalism that has re-entered public discourse. Certainly, as my Bloc colleague has suggested, I think any discussion in the House needs to be victim-centred. It needs to be survivor-centred. When we propose legislation, I think it is important that we have a duty and responsibility to think about all the ways in which our rhetoric and our communications might be received in the general public and might actually cause some harm.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336962" data-originallang="en">Before I even begin my remarks, I just want to reflect on, given the nature of the particular reactionary piece of legislation before us, the impacts that Bernardo had in my community. As the member for Hamilton Centre, I know that members will recall that two of his victims were in my region. In the early 1990s, as a young adult of 12 or 13 years, I recall, crystal clear, being at a recreation centre at a karate tournament when the news broke of the atrocities that had happened in the community. As I am sure every member of the House does, when I reflect upon the monstrosities that were committed, I go back through them. Of course, we all know that Leslie Erin Mahaffy, Kristen French and Tammy Homolka were the three victims of the two brutal and vicious criminals.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336963" data-originallang="en">However, sometimes what is lost is that there were also survivors. There are people who are watching this debate right now who would have had a direct connection, a very violent and traumatic connection, to the atrocities committed by Paul Bernardo. I want people who are watching to know that I and the New Democrats, and indeed many folks in here across all party lines, want to reflect on the fact that they are still living through the horrors that have been expressed in the House, and we want to make sure that any approach we have would be victim-centred.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336964" data-originallang="en">However, I do not believe that the particular piece of legislation before us is necessarily victim-centred. I do not believe that it would offer victims any of the four foundational principles of victim-centred approaches to things like sexual assault, gender-based violence and the idea of safety and respect. I think that one of the most atrocious, evil and despicable things that a human being can do to another person has been sensationalized and generalized, such that all people caught within the frameworks would be comparable to it. I would suggest that is not the case. I want to honour the survivors who might be tuning in, and I want them to know that if there is any good that comes of the current debate, it is that we should be shifting our justice strategies so that they are not just about crime and punishment but also, again, about victim-centred and survivor-centred approaches.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336965" data-originallang="en">Let us be clear about what the bill would do; it would amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act to require that inmates who have been found to be dangerous offenders, or have been convicted of more than one first-degree murder, be assigned to a security classification of maximum and be confined in a maximum-security penitentiary or area in a penitentiary for the duration of their sentence. Indeed, it is a reflection, and I think all social scientists would agree, of a failed tough-on-crime approach. The reason is that, within the due bounds of our law, there are scenarios, setting aside the atrocities of Paul Bernardo, where, based on this, people would eventually end up leaving prison.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336966" data-originallang="en">Therefore the question becomes this: What is it that we are unleashing into our community once these people have been incarcerated for decades of their lives? How are we reflecting upon the impacts of any prospect of rehabilitation lost by the failed social approach, the failed Conservative approach, to tough-on-crime? If we put violent people, deeply problematic people and people who were traumatized into settings that continue to dehumanize them, then eventually we will have to work through what will happen when they return to our communities.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336967" data-originallang="en">It is not like there are no better examples around the world. We only have to look to what some Scandinavian countries have done when it comes to rehabilitation. Norway's rate of recidivism decreased from a high of 70% in 1992 to the lowest in the world, at 20%, after it started community-based correctional facilities and focused on rehabilitation.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336968" data-originallang="en">When I say these words, it is important for the public and the members in the House to not conflate the evils and the monstrosities of the worst and the most violent among us and to understand that laws ought not to be a knee-jerk response to individual failings or to individual cases, but actually need to be a collective response to our society's social pressures.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336969" data-originallang="en">In the U.S., with it's toughness on crime, which the “Canadian Republican Party” has seemed to have adopted, the rate of return is 76.6%. Even the fiscal Conservatives among them, the ones who are truly fiscal Conservatives, would recognize that the cost of incarceration is enormous. There needs to be discretion. There needs to be the ability for those who are honestly taking steps for rehabilitation to be rehabilitated and to go from the institutionalization of a maximum-security prison to conditions that would better match the realities of the outside world so that when they are released, the likelihood of them reoffending drops.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336970" data-originallang="en">That is not my opinion; those are the facts, but unfortunately, punishment is the only tool the Conservatives have in their tool box when dealing with these issues. Rehabilitation is not even in their vocabulary. Their position in this regard is one that is sensationalist and does prey upon the most basic and base fears of society and is based on the most evil who walk among us. There are exceptional cases of violence in this country. I am not naive to that. There are people who have done unspeakable things, but our system currently deals with that.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336971" data-originallang="en">Were there administrative errors? Could there be administrative errors from time to time? Absolutely, that could be the case. However, concerning the transfer of Paul Bernardo, Dr. Ivan Zinger, the Correctional Investigator of Canada, in his written submission to the SECU committee on November 27, wrote, “In this case, it is especially important to make clear that Canada's correctional system is based on the principle that the rule of law follows sentenced persons into prison.”</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336972" data-originallang="en">Imprisonment does not mean total deprivation and absolute forfeiture of one's rights. The investigator went on to say, “My Office cannot, and does not, select or decline cases on the basis of one's criminal conduct or notoriety. My Office serves all federally sentenced persons, regardless of their sentence.” That is the underlying principle of the rule of law.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336973" data-originallang="en">I would encourage members of the House, including the so-called “tough on crime” Conservatives, to reflect on ways, perhaps in the remaining months of this session and in the remaining time we are in this legislature and this Parliament, to shift their thinking and to start actually thinking about the victims and the survivors of crime as the primary priority for our legislative responses. I would like them to think about the material conditions for people currently within our federal prison systems. I would like them to think about the investments that could be made to support people in mental health and to support people in social crisis.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336974" data-originallang="en">With that, I am thankful for this time. I will take my last five seconds to reflect upon not just the victims who were murdered by Paul Bernardo, but also upon all the survivors who may be watching this. They should know that, as New Democrats, our hearts go out to them, to their families and to the communities impacted by this.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="8336978" data-originallang="en">After Bernardo, that monster, was found guilty of his crimes, the judge correctly sentenced him to life imprisonment as a dangerous offender, meaning he should have stayed locked up in maximum security until he died of old age. However, no, our current government, this woke bunch of MPs who are running our justice system, decided that Paul Bernardo is the real victim, a nice, fine, misunderstood fellow who deserves medium security.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336979" data-originallang="en">The Liberals passed a law, Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="10078426" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=10078426&amp;Language=E">C-83</a>, which explicitly tells police, judges and Correctional Services Canada to impose the least restrictive measures on a person as possible. In practice, this means that this monster, Paul Bernardo, now lives in a dormitory, has a tennis court and ice rink for recreation, and access to sharp instruments when he gets that urge to murder again. It is not even close to maximum security. That makes no sense.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336980" data-originallang="en">On June 23 last year, I asked the justice minister, in this very House. why Paul Bernardo gets such special treatment. What was his answer? Of course, he did not answer at all. Instead, one of the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a>’s attack dogs got up to say that, just because Paul Bernardo is a bad man, it does not mean the Liberals did anything wrong with their legislation.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336981" data-originallang="en">Yes, everyone heard me right: the Liberals refused to take responsibility for their own actions. However, members need not worry. Since the current NDP-Liberal government refuses to take responsibility for its own actions, it will be the Conservatives who once again step up to the plate to fix the situation.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336982" data-originallang="en">What would that fix? Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="12566649" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=12566649&amp;Language=E">C-351</a> is a bill introduced by my great Conservative colleague from Quebec. This legislation would fix the mess created by the Liberals in the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. It would amend section 28 of the act, which currently states, “If a person is or is to be confined in a penitentiary, the Service shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that the penitentiary in which they are confined is one that provides them with the least restrictive environment”.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336983" data-originallang="en">That is what the Liberals have changed it to say. They made it as easy on the convicted criminal as possible. This is why Bernardo is getting all the special treatment.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336984" data-originallang="en">My colleague's bill proposes to change that section to say, “ensure that the penitentiary in which they are confined is one that provides them with an environment that contains only the necessary restrictions”. In other words, only make it easier on a convicted criminal if it is absolutely necessary. This legislation is making a significant fix through changing the words “least restrictive environment” to “environment that contains only the necessary restrictions”. While it is a simple language change, it is a massive policy change.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336985" data-originallang="en">When it comes to crime and what to do with criminals who victimize Canadians, Conservatives, such as myself, my colleague and our <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="291215" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=291215&amp;Language=E">leader</a>, have very different approaches than those of the NDP-Liberal government. Conservatives believe that victims of crimes, those who are innocent, who have been terrorized in their own homes, have had their cars stolen, have been mugged on our streets, who have been are raped and those who have had family members murdered, should come first.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336986" data-originallang="en">The NDP-Liberals have a very different approach than Conservatives do to crime. I believe in common sense. If a crime was committed, the criminal needs to answer. The woke, NDP-Liberal approach is that the criminal is the single most important person in the justice system. They believe, and they have written into law, that police, prosecutors, judges, jurors, and jailers must take into account diversity, equity, inclusion and critical race theory when dealing with criminals. They have put into place checklists. Does this criminal have any sort of skin colour, racial background, sexual identity or anything in their background that would warrant that criminal to walk away scot-free? If so, let them go. That is the NDP-Liberal approach to criminal justice.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336987" data-originallang="en">This woke crowd does not care if a criminal has raped a woman, kidnapped a child or murdered a indigenous man because, in their minds, that so-called underprivileged criminal is more important than any victim can be. In their topsy-turvy world view, it actually sees those committing the crimes as the people who need to be cared for, while the actual victims continue to suffer over and over again.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336988" data-originallang="en">Senator Kim Pate, appointed by the current Liberal <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a>, summed up the Liberal hug-a-thug position quite nicely last year when she addressed the Fredericton City Council. She said, “Canada’s criminal legal system is unjust, discriminatory and biased against indigenous people and people of colour.”</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336989" data-originallang="en">I agree that it has been unjust against indigenous victims of crime like those on the James Smith Cree Nation. The coroner's inquest, which was held in my home riding of Saskatoon West, by the way, was clear on the point. The man who murdered all those indigenous people on the reserve should never have been released in the first place. However, folks like Senator Pate do not particularly care about those victims, do they? Instead, they are making excuses for the inexcusable. Senator Pate is one of the many examples of what is absolutely wrong with NDP-Liberal justice.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336990" data-originallang="en"> Once a crime is committed, the criminal must be punished, period. That is why a common-sense Conservative government will bring in tough-on-crime legislation. We will lock up the criminals. We will stop the crime. “Diversity, equity, inclusion” and critical race theory approaches that lead to “hug a thug” and to repeat offenders will be swept away. Common-sense Conservatives will bring back mandatory minimums. We will crack down on the people who sexually exploit our children and on the people who peddle sexually explicit images of children on the Internet. Indeed, my Conservative colleague for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278216" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278216&amp;Language=E">North Okanagan—Shuswap</a> brought in his private member’s bill, Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11849645" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11849645&amp;Language=E">C-291</a>, to do this very thing.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336991" data-originallang="en">We will take the issue of women being trafficked into sexual slavery seriously and not laugh it off as sex workers and body positivity, as men pay their pimps in order to abuse and demean women. My colleague, the Conservative MP for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278476" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278476&amp;Language=E">Peace River—Westlock</a> has introduced legislation in the House to accomplish this through Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="12097734" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=12097734&amp;Language=E">C-308</a>, an act respecting the national strategy to combat human trafficking.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336992" data-originallang="en">We will ensure that men who commit violence against pregnant women face stiffer sentences. The NDP and the Liberals voted to kill the legislation, based on the justification that beating a pregnant woman senseless is just another form of abortion, almost as if that were a good thing. I would argue that the last thing a civilized country like Canada should do is beat pregnant women and not punish criminals properly for it. I proudly supported the legislation brought forward by my Conservative colleague, the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278361" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278361&amp;Language=E">Yorkton—Melville</a>, that would have allowed the judge to consider pregnancy as an aggravating factor when sentencing someone who has beaten a pregnant woman.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336993" data-originallang="en"> Shall I give another example? Why not? Let us contrast, juxtapose and expose the soft-on-crime approach of the NDP-Liberals. My Conservative colleague, the MP for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278158" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278158&amp;Language=E">Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman</a>, has introduced Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11881876" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11881876&amp;Language=E">C-296</a>, the respecting families of murdered and brutalized persons act, which would make life imprisonment actually life imprisonment. That means that if someone commits—</p>

Its members need to stop supporting the Liberals if that is what they want.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336998" data-originallang="en">Life imprisonment would mean that if someone commits murder and gets a life sentence, they would serve a minimum of 25 to 40 years before parole eligibility. Let us face it: Right now the sentences under the current woke system of putting criminals first mean letting murderers walk away after very little time served.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8336999" data-originallang="en"> I will give colleagues some examples. Many may recall that a few years back, the NDP-Liberals made changes to ease up on the sentencing rules. Around that time, Christopher Garnier drugged, raped and murdered off-duty Halifax police officer Catherine Campbell. He did horrible things to her, spread her body parts around Halifax and treated her remains like human garbage, according to the judge. As outraged as the judge was, the best he could do was to sentence the serial rapist and now murderer to 13 and a half years, reduced to only 11 years with time served. Imagine that, 11 years for drugging, raping, murdering and desecrating the body of a police officer. By the way, the coroner testified that it took Catherine Campbell six minutes to die by strangulation after her rape; that is just two years of prison time for every minute he took to kill her. This could happen only in Canada and only in the NDP-Liberals' woke version of Canada.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8337000" data-originallang="en">Let us talk about Rylen Heavenfire in Calgary; this man got only four years for shooting and killing his brother with a gun. The facts are undisputed: “Heavenfire pointed the shotgun he was carrying at his brother and shot him in the face”, yet the judge said the man could be rehabilitated. What about punishing Heavenfire for taking the life of his brother? Does his brother’s life not count even a little bit, or is the victim in this story just another piece of human garbage?</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8337001" data-originallang="en">The scales of justice are represented by an icon of a lady wearing a blindfold. She does not see race, skin colour or whom one prays to. All she cares about is balancing the scales. What is fair to the victims is justice. Is four years for raising a shotgun, pulling the trigger and murdering one's brother really justice? Conservatives believe that if someone murders someone, then they should be punished for their crime. For those of us with actual common sense, it is not the victims who should be treated like human garbage.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8337002" data-originallang="en">Let me wrap up by saying that I and my colleagues in the Conservative Party fully support the legislation in front of us today. We believe in common-sense justice. We believe criminals like Paul Bernardo who were sentenced to maximum security should not be getting special treatment. They should be in maximum security. We believe in justice for repeat victims, not coddling repeat criminals. Conservatives believe in protecting families in their homes, not allowing rapists and murderers to roam our streets unpunished. It is time to stop the crime. It is time to bring it home.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="8337005" data-originallang="fr">I will not go into the details of the context surrounding the introduction of such a bill. I will simply point out that what prompted it was the news last June that serial killer Paul Bernardo had been transferred from a maximum-security prison to a medium-security one. It was news that shocked the public and forced the families and victims to relive their trauma. This bill seeks to ensure that maximum-security offenders remain in a maximum-security facility, where they deserve to be.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8337006" data-originallang="fr">I would once again like to thank my colleague from <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278693" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278693&amp;Language=E">Niagara Falls</a>, who introduced a similar bill, as well as a motion calling for the immediate cancellation of Bernardo's transfer. Unfortunately, his motion was defeated.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8337007" data-originallang="fr">I listened carefully to my colleagues' speeches, in the first hour of reading and today, and I have a few comments to make.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8337008" data-originallang="fr">My Liberal colleagues mentioned that we do not care about women. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our Conservative Party has always stood with victims. Unfortunately, when it comes to dangerous offenders, the vast majority of victims are women. I also heard the Liberals say that we are using this bill to fearmonger. They falsely claim that we want to make people believe that offenders like Bernardo could end up being released. That is not the purpose of this bill at all.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8337009" data-originallang="fr">The probability that such a dangerous criminal would be out on release is extremely low. However, the fact that he was transferred from a maximum- to a medium-security prison is something we want to prevent. I repeat, the very simple goal of this bill is to ensure that such criminals, given their horrific actions, are kept in maximum-security prisons, not in institutions where they would receive much more generous privileges. Most importantly, we want to prevent the families of victims from having to relive a trauma that no one would want to experience.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8337010" data-originallang="fr">Other colleagues have also talked about rehabilitation. I heard someone say earlier that we do not believe in it. That is absolutely not the case. Our party does believe in rehabilitation, especially for young offenders. For some offences, a second chance is the way forward, but in the Bernardo case, for example, I am sure members will agree that rehabilitation is impossible. A second chance for such a monster is out of the question. We are talking about at least 1,000 inmates in Canada who are considered dangerous offenders.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8337011" data-originallang="fr">As evidence of the current government's soft-on-crime attitude, the response to an Order Paper question submitted by my colleague from <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278564" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278564&amp;Language=E">Kamloops—Thompson—Cariboo</a> revealed that most of these offenders are serving their sentences in medium- or even minimum-security prisons. There are dangerous offenders in minimum-security institutions. That is what happens when a government does not have its priorities straight, when a government believes that the right thing to do is to offer dangerous criminals the least restrictive environment. That is what happened in 2019 with the passage of Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="10078426" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=10078426&amp;Language=E">C-83</a>, which puts the comfort of criminals ahead of concern for victims' families. That is pure liberalism. That is the legacy of the Liberal government after nine years in power.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8337012" data-originallang="fr">On this side of the House, we stand by the victims and not the criminals. That is why I introduced this bill and I am proud of it. Where the Liberals have failed, we will succeed. We will restore common sense in our justice and correctional system. </p>
