    <div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-13,3" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="An Act for the Substantive Equality of Canada's Official Languages" data-intervention-type="Debate" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278948" data-person-speaking-attribution="Hon. Ginette Petitpas Taylor (Minister of Official Languages and Minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Lib.)" data-timestamp="2023-05-12 10:00:00" id="12211109"><p class="procedural" data-HoCid="7772826">moved that Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C‑13, An Act to amend the Official Languages Act, to enact the Use of French in Federally Regulated Private Businesses Act and to make related amendments to other Acts</a>, be read the third time and passed. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772827" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, hon. members, colleagues and friends, I am extremely pleased to be here to speak to you today. To begin, I would like to acknowledge that we are gathered here on the traditional territory of the Anishinabe Algonquin nation.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772828" data-originallang="fr">Bill C‑13, an act for the substantive equality of Canada's official languages, is now in the hands of members for debate at third reading. At the end of the debate, members will have to decide whether the bill will pass in the House of Commons. I know they will give it due consideration in light of the bill's vital role in promoting Canada's two official languages, halting the decline of French in the country and ensuring that our nation's official language minority communities thrive.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772829" data-originallang="fr">I thank them in advance and I assure them once again of my full co-operation.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772830" data-originallang="en">Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> has not yet reached the end of its legislative journey, but the fact that it has made it this far is an achievement worth noting. There has been lively debate, sometimes tense, often emotional but always productive. The operative word here is “productive”, because that is the message we should take away from this process. Without such debate, we could not claim to live in a healthy democracy and we would not have the robust bill that we have before us today.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772831" data-originallang="en">We all have strong convictions about official languages because they define us and are central to our identity. At times, those convictions can divide us. Fortunately, however, everyone has done their bit and we have managed to come together because, despite our differing views, we recognize that our official languages contribute to Canada's development and are integral to the image that Canada projects in the world. I am delighted to have found common ground with the Government of Quebec, which is a key player in the Canadian and international Francophonie. We can be proud of the progress we have made to date.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772832" data-originallang="en">I would also like to take a moment to thank the members of the Standing Committee on Official Languages for going through this bill clause by clause and, I have to say, with a fine-tooth comb. I know that, over the past year, they have devoted 26 meetings to this bill and proposed upward of 200 amendments. Some amendments from each party were adopted. Thanks to that colossal effort, Canadians can rest assured that Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> is on the right track. There is nothing more reassuring than knowing that a bill has passed the test of the House of Commons. Moreover, official-language minority communities have expressed relief, knowing that Bill C-13 has finally reached third reading. That alone is evidence enough for me that this bill has met the expectations on the ground.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772833" data-originallang="fr">A reform of this magnitude cannot be undertaken by just one player. It must be the result of collaborative thinking and must embrace all points of view.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772834" data-originallang="fr">We were able to do just that with Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> thanks to the thousands of people who stepped forward to present their views on official languages even before the reform began and who have continued to do so all along.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772835" data-originallang="fr">Let us remember that, in 2019, on the 50th anniversary of the Official Languages Act, Canadians expressed their commitment to our two official languages. They made it clear that they want to build on that legacy. Francophones and anglophones enthusiastically participated in the round tables and symposia that we organized across the country and online.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772836" data-originallang="fr">Every clause of this bill reflects their hopes, dreams and concerns. We did the impossible by incorporating all of that into the text of this legislation in order to preserve the spirit of their vision and make a difference in their daily lives. It is also important to point out that we took every opportunity to improve the bill for Canadians.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772837" data-originallang="fr"> I want to once again take a moment to recognize the work done by my friend and colleague, the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278918" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278918&amp;Language=E">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a>, when she was responsible for official languages. She was the one who started the major work of reforming our language regime, which included reaching out to stakeholders across the country. She was driven by sincere empathy and a desire to forge a friendship with official language minority communities.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772838" data-originallang="fr">She did not hesitate in the least when it came time to stand up for their institutions. As a francophone and a Montrealer, she demonstrated how important it is for Quebec's francophones to show solidarity with francophones in other provinces and territories.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772839" data-originallang="fr">I myself come from an official language minority community, and I personally felt her positive energy. I want to thank her again. In 2021, her efforts culminated in the tabling of the reform document entitled “English and French: Towards a substantive equality of official languages in Canada”, which proposed 56 legislative, administrative and regulatory amendments. Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> embodies the government's vision for a modernized act.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772840" data-originallang="fr">We have been fortunate to strike the right legislative balance on official languages. Our experience with Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11420727" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11420727&amp;Language=E">C-32</a>, the predecessor to Bill C‑13, was very enlightening. It enabled us to improve the bill to make it even more robust. Ultimately, Canadians are the ones who will benefit.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772841" data-originallang="en">An objective of the language reform has always been clear: to strengthen and modernize our Official Languages Act. Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> would be one pillar of that reform. In adopting this bill, we would be laying the groundwork for substantive equality between French and English in Canada. Bill C-13 also seeks to ensure that Canadians would be able to live and thrive in both official languages.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772842" data-originallang="en">The bill would recognize the importance of bilingualism to Canadian identity. In concrete terms, this would mean providing Canada with legislative tools to curb the decline of French; better protect the institutions of official-language minority communities, including English-speaking Quebeckers; improve the compliance of federal institutions by strengthening the powers of the Commissioner of Official Languages and the role of the Treasury Board in part 7 of the act; and promote individual bilingualism in Canada.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772843" data-originallang="en">People might ask, “What difference would this make in the lives of Canadians?” Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> would make a difference in a number of areas, as it would represent major gains for communities across the country. First, it would recognize the special status of French, which is in a minority situation in Canada and also in North America due to the predominant use of English. That recognition would make all the difference because it would pave the way for the necessary legislative measures to protect French, and Bill C-13 would take all the necessary measures.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772844" data-originallang="en">Across the country, the stakeholders who best understand the challenges facing our official languages are urging us to pass Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> as soon as possible. Their calls to action have grown louder and louder in recent months, and I have to say that it is for good reason. Halting the decline of French will require a team effort on the part of all stakeholders, including communities, the Government of Canada, our provincial and territorial colleagues and Parliament itself. We can imagine what would happen if we just stood by and watched. The demographic weight of francophones continues to slide, and the demographic weight has already been below the critical threshold for some time now, which has francophones and francophiles worried.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772845" data-originallang="en">Canada has now met its target for francophone immigration to minority communities for the first time since it set its targets in 2003. To be sure, this achievement is great news, and we have every reason to be delighted. It confirms that we have the capacity to act, and that well-managed efforts yield results, something we tend to doubt at times. However, we also know that we cannot afford to become complacent. We must do more and we must do better. We have made sure that Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> contains provisions to counter the decline of French, including by investing in francophone immigration. It is so crucial that our immigration policy include objectives, targets and also indicators that are conducive to increasing francophone immigration outside of Quebec.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772846" data-originallang="en">More generally, Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> would provide better support for the French language throughout Canada, including in Quebec and also internationally. Such support would necessarily include increased protection for institutions of francophone minority communities across the country, whose vitality would be strengthened as a result. We recognize the positive effects of a vibrant language on the well-being and development of a community. Every action taken to strengthen a language yields profound, life-giving benefits for the people who speak it. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772847" data-originallang="en">As members have often heard me say in the House, French is the only official language in Canada that is under threat; as such, we must do more in order to protect it. At the same time, we need to understand that increased support for French in no way represents a reduced commitment by the government to English-speaking Quebeckers in Quebec. Our commitment to those communities and their vitality remains firm and unwavering. On this point, I want to reassure Canadians that the provisions of Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> aimed at protecting linguistic minorities and minority institutions would apply to all official-language minority communities in Canada, including English-speaking Quebeckers.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772848" data-originallang="fr">For a bill to have a real impact, it needs to have teeth. If not, how could we enforce linguistic rights in this country? I must say that Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C‑13</a> has the teeth we need.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772849" data-originallang="fr">It enhances the enforcement of part VII of the Official Languages Act to better regulate the implementation of positive measures by federal institutions and to clarify the duty of federal institutions to take the necessary measures to promote the inclusion of language clauses in agreements negotiated with the provinces and territories. It enhances the powers of the Treasury Board to ensure better coordination and accountability with respect to official languages across the entire Government of Canada. It strengthens the powers of the Commissioner of Official Languages, giving him more tools, such as the power to enter into compliance agreements, make orders or even impose monetary penalties on certain private businesses and Crown corporations in the transportation sector that communicate with and serve the travelling public. As I already mentioned, the bill also enhances the francophone immigration policy.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772850" data-originallang="fr">Finally, it enacts a new act that will strengthen the use of French in federally regulated private businesses in Quebec and in regions with a strong francophone presence outside Quebec. What is more, the recently proposed amendments to this new legislation seek to enhance and clarify the federal system with respect to the use of French in businesses.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772851" data-originallang="fr">One of the priority areas of Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> was to take into account the varying realities of the provinces and territories. Once again, I am pleased that we were able to come to an agreement with the Government of Quebec on this crucial point.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772852" data-originallang="en">The second pillar supporting our language regime is our action plan for official languages 2023-28, entitled “Protection-Promotion-Collaboration”. That new action plan, which I recently unveiled, would support the implementation of Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> by putting forward a historic investment of more than $4.1 billion to support the vitality of our official-language minority communities from coast to coast to coast.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772853" data-originallang="en">Our plan is built on four key pillars: francophone immigration, supporting lifelong learning, strong measures to support communities, and a federal government that must lead by example. With the adoption of Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> and the historic investment made with our new action plan, our government would be sending a clear signal that our official languages are a priority for the government.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772854" data-originallang="fr">The bill has been a long time in the making. It has now come to fruition. I understand that some members might still be hesitant to pass this legislation, so I want everyone to know that a lot of hard work has gone into balancing the wishes of all Canadians, especially the wishes of official language minority communities and the wishes of their governments.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772855" data-originallang="fr">As members who care deeply about the interests of our constituents, we know that our priorities can differ from one another, and reconciling those priorities is not always easy. However, I am confident that Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> reflects everyone's interests to the extent possible and will bring tangible gains for each of our communities across the country. Bill C‑13 will help protect and promote French across Canada, including in Quebec. Once again, I would like to salute the spirit of co-operation that has made this such a great success.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772856" data-originallang="fr">As a francophone and an Acadian from Moncton, I never forget who I am and where I come from. I am most proud of having been able to introduce Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> virtually from Grand-Pré in Nova Scotia, the cradle of Acadia, as I like to call it. It is a place that reminds us of a people's struggle to preserve their language and culture in the face of the violence and assimilation they endured. In my part of the country, people have great hopes for this language reform. They have a great deal to lose if Bill C‑13 falls short.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772857" data-originallang="fr">I certainly am not going to disappoint them, and I feel confident that everything has been done to meet their expectations and those of all Canadians. Everyone can rest assured of that.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772858" data-originallang="fr">Therefore, it is with the utmost confidence that I invite my colleagues to pass this bill as quickly as possible. The members of the Standing Senate Committee on Official Languages have already carried out a pre-study of Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a>. I now invite them to continue the work.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772859" data-originallang="fr">I now look forward to questions from my colleagues.</p>

<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-13,3" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="An Act for the Substantive Equality of Canada's Official Languages" data-intervention-type="Debate" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278452" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. Joël Godin (Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier, CPC)" data-timestamp="2023-05-12 10:15:00" id="12211250"><p data-HoCid="7772860" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for this presentation.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772861" data-originallang="fr">I am disappointed that the minister truly believes what she is saying. She said that she incorporated everything that was in the white paper into Bill C‑13. The white paper said that the central agency should be the Treasury Board and that it should have full power over the entire act. That was written in the white paper.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772862" data-originallang="fr">The minister also said that in the process of developing the bill, she considered all the requests submitted by organizations representing official language minority communities. The Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada, or the FCFA, has made one clear request. The entire act needs to be overseen by the Treasury Board. Why did the minister not simply extend the Treasury Board's responsibility to encompass the entire act?</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772863" data-originallang="fr">I have other questions. Regarding immigration, the minister said that, coincidentally, since 2023, there has been a 4.4% target. In the Liberals' marketing strategy this year, they note that, coincidentally, just as Bill C‑13 was being introduced, they reached the target. In the bill, the only thing the Department of Citizenship and Immigration needs to do is set targets and indicators.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772864" data-originallang="fr">We all know that we are behind and that we have some catching up to do. The FCFA recommends an increase of 12% to 20% to make up for lost time. Who will make the Department of Citizenship and Immigration fulfill its commitments? Who in this government will hold the department accountable so that it meets its immigration targets?</p>
	</div>
<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-13,3" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="An Act for the Substantive Equality of Canada's Official Languages" data-intervention-type="Interjection" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278948" data-person-speaking-attribution="Hon. Ginette Petitpas Taylor" data-timestamp="2023-05-12 10:15:00" id="12211271"><p data-HoCid="7772865" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for his questions and his work on the Standing Committee on Official Languages. I think that co-operation really is key. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772866" data-originallang="fr">We understand just how important our two official languages are to our beautiful country, and we can always do more. That is why we introduced an ambitious and robust bill. We often speak about stakeholders across the country. In recent months, the FCFA and many other stakeholders have asked us to pass this bill as soon as possible. They have also said publicly that it is a very good bill.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772867" data-originallang="fr">With regard to the question about the Treasury Board, we made absolutely sure that the Treasury Board will play the role of coordinator for the act. In last fall's economic statement, we put money aside to ensure that the Treasury Board has the resources it needs to do its job.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772868" data-originallang="fr">Let us also look at the matter of francophone immigration. I think that we were very clear in our bill that we want to ensure that we have a robust francophone immigration policy with targets, indicators and so on. Once again, we recognize that francophone immigration is very important to compensate for the demographic loss in this country.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772869" data-originallang="fr">In addition to introducing this bill, we have made historic investments of $4.1 billion in the action plan, and that includes $137 million for francophone immigration.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772870" data-originallang="fr">However, I do have a question for my hon. Conservative colleague. Will the Conservatives finally support Bill C‑13?</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772871" data-originallang="fr">The Bloc Québécois, the NDP and the province of Quebec say that it is a good bill. I hope my colleague will answer. Will they support it, yes or no?</p>
	</div>
<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-13,3" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="An Act for the Substantive Equality of Canada's Official Languages" data-intervention-type="Debate" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278678" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. Mario Beaulieu (La Pointe-de-l'Île, BQ)" data-timestamp="2023-05-12 10:20:00" id="12211311"><p data-HoCid="7772872" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, let me set the record straight: The Bloc Québécois is not saying that this is a good bill. The Bloc is going to support it because we feel that it will move things somewhat forward for now, but there are still a lot of unsatisfactory aspects.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772873" data-originallang="fr">The Government of Quebec asked to be in control of language planning within its territory. It also asked for recognition that French is the only minority official language. It requested a truly differentiated approach and asked that Quebec be the one to take positive measures, whether for French or English. It wants to have a say, it wanted a say in this.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772874" data-originallang="fr">The official languages plan was unveiled about a week and a half ago, and it is expected that $800 million will once again be spent primarily on English. The Quebec government has asked that it be used for French integration instead. Everyone in Quebec wondered why, when French is under threat, almost all the funding is going to English. I am actually pretty happy about that because usually this kind of thing would go unnoticed.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772875" data-originallang="fr">The minister said that part of that amount was for the teaching of French as a second language. That is generally a part of Canada-Quebec agreements, but only a small percentage, maybe 5% to 6%, is earmarked for French second-language teaching. Most of the funding goes to support the English school system. That is what we heard from a public servant who spoke anonymously.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772876" data-originallang="fr">My question for the minister is this. Is the government open to the possibility of increasing support for French in the positive measures and to adjusting its approach based on the requests of the Government of Quebec, taking into account the fact that French is in decline and that measures really do need to be taken? Furthermore, the federal measures that hasten the decline of French must be stopped.</p>
	</div>
<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-13,3" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="An Act for the Substantive Equality of Canada's Official Languages" data-intervention-type="Interjection" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278948" data-person-speaking-attribution="Hon. Ginette Petitpas Taylor" data-timestamp="2023-05-12 10:20:00" id="12211338"><p data-HoCid="7772877" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, once again, I want to thank my Bloc Québécois colleague for the work he has done on the Standing Committee on Official Languages.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772878" data-originallang="fr">I think we share a common goal with the Bloc Québécois. We recognize that French is the only one of Canada's official languages in decline and that we need to work together to address this decline. I must also mention that we are the first government to recognize that French is the only one of Canada's official languages that is in decline. To counter this decline, we introduced an ambitious and robust bill.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772879" data-originallang="fr">Also, last week, or two weeks ago, we announced an action plan containing unprecedented investments of $4.1 billion that will really make a difference. If we have any hope of ensuring that Canada's francophonie will thrive, we have to follow through with the necessary investments. As I often say, if the francophonie is thriving across Canada, it will surely thrive in Quebec as well.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772880" data-originallang="fr">I should also say that the Quebec government has publicly stated that Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> is a very good bill. This week, I even had the chance to talk with Minister Roberge. Quebec wants this bill to pass as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772881" data-originallang="fr">I would like to once again thank my Bloc Québécois colleague, who openly and publicly stated that he will support the bill. This bill is really going to make a difference for our official language minority communities and it will also help us address the decline of French across the country, including in Quebec.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="7772886" data-originallang="en">If this were an easy piece of legislation, governments in the past would have moved it forward a long time ago. We had the ambition, and we wanted to make it a priority.

I took it as a priority to meet with stakeholders to make sure we had an appreciation of what they wanted to see. We have moved forward with presenting a robust piece of legislation that really meets the needs of the interveners from coast to coast to coast. It would make a real, tangible difference in making sure that we address the decline of French, all while supporting our official-language minority communities from across the country.</p>

I will therefore be sharing my time with the member for Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772903" data-originallang="fr">As I rise in the House today, I cannot help but feel disappointed. All that, for this? The Liberals tabled a white paper in February 2021 that clearly stated in black and white that the Treasury Board was to become the central agency responsible for implementing the Official Languages Act, as I pointed out in my question earlier. A few months later, in June 2021, the official languages minister at the time, currently the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278918" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278918&amp;Language=E">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a>, introduced Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11420727" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11420727&amp;Language=E">C-32</a>. An election was called two months later. What a coincidence. A lot of time was wasted, and we had to start over at square one.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772904" data-originallang="fr">The new <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278926" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278926&amp;Language=E">Minister of Official Languages</a> introduced her bill, <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a>, in March 2022. We were told that the bill solved all the problems and that it had to be passed as quickly as possible. The Liberals begged the opposition parties to co-operate and expedite the bill. It was referred to the Standing Committee on Official Languages, where we heard from witnesses so we could do our work effectively. All of a sudden, the Liberals moved a motion to cut off debate. We had to move so quickly that we wasted eight meetings discussing this problem that had been caused by the Liberals at committee. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772905" data-originallang="fr">They are talking out of both sides of their mouths. They want us to move quickly, but they muzzled us for eight meetings. The opposition parties worked together to take the time needed. We reached out to the Liberals several times to try to get them to listen to reason. They wanted four meetings and we wanted twelve, so we split the difference and decided on eight. I think that is a good compromise. It shows that the opposition parties were acting in good faith. As for the Liberals, that is another story.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772906" data-originallang="fr">The Conservative Party takes bilingualism in Canada very seriously. We worked hard in committee, as I mentioned. We took the time to listen to stakeholders across the country. We worked to respond to their concerns. I am talking about stakeholders like the Fédération des communautés francophone et acadienne du Canada, the Fédération nationale des conseils scolaires francophones, the Commissioner of Official Languages and many others. These people live with the reality of being a linguistic minority every day. The Liberals would have everyone living in these official language minority communities, particularly in New Brunswick, believe that they are responding to their demands.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772907" data-originallang="fr">I want to tell everyone living in those official language minority communities—whether it is in New Brunswick, the Northwest Territories or British Columbia—not to worry, because the Conservative Party of Canada is there for them and always will be.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772908" data-originallang="fr">In committee, we received a pile of amendments from all parties. About 10 amendments were tabled by the NDP; the Bloc proposed over 80, and we tabled about 60.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772909" data-originallang="fr">It comes as no surprise that the Liberals were ready. They had written a white paper, then introduced Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11420727" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11420727&amp;Language=E">C-32</a>, followed by Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a>. They must have refined their bill, at least I hope so. However, they filed about 50 amendments, which is pretty interesting. In addition to the 50 amendments, it was clear that there was some dissension within the Liberal caucus. Among those 50 amendments, there were duplicates, which means that two Liberal members had tabled the same amendments. This goes to show how much time they are wasting. Are they even talking within their party? Are they talking to the anglophone members from Quebec? It is a mess. Then they want us to move quickly. They say this issue is so important. This is just one example of Liberal incompetence and inconsistency. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772910" data-originallang="fr">Again this week in the House, the Liberals proposed amendments that could and should have been put forward in committee—but no, they are holding up the process. They claim that it needs to move quickly, but they are holding up the process. Worse, to hear the Liberals talk about official languages, the decline of the French language and the need to protect both official languages, it all seems to be so important to them. However, there was a vote at report stage yesterday, and the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="263835" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=263835&amp;Language=E">Deputy Prime Minister</a>, whom we have been looking for in all the committees, and even in the House of Commons, did not even vote, even though we have a virtual application to do just that. The <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="245291" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=245291&amp;Language=E">Minister of Justice</a>, who is a Quebecker and is affected by this legislation, did not even vote. Worse yet, the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278929" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278929&amp;Language=E">Minister of Canadian Heritage</a> and Quebec lieutenant, who is the main party involved and has responsibilities under this bill, did not even vote. Official languages and the decline of the French language are so very important to them—we had another clear demonstration of that yesterday.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772911" data-originallang="fr">This government's lack of interest and disengagement is obvious again today. What day is it? It is Friday, the day when members have the least amount of time to speak. Who is in charge of the agenda? The Liberals are. Who chose to do this on a Friday? The Liberals did. What does that mean? It means that they do not want to hear about this, that they want to sweep it under the rug. That is obvious, because there is bickering within the Liberal caucus. This is just more smoke and mirrors, to create the illusion that the Liberals care about official languages.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772912" data-originallang="fr">Let us talk about the stakeholders. We met several, but I want to talk about two in particular. The Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada, or FCFA, which represents 2.8 million French-speaking Canadians outside Quebec, was calling for six amendments. It was not a huge or unreasonable request. How many of those amendments were fully adopted? Not one was adopted. Good job, Liberals. The Conservative Party agrees with those recommendations and brought forward amendments along those lines. Unfortunately, the NDP-Liberal coalition ignored the FCFA. It did the same thing to the Commissioner of Official Languages. The Liberals and the NDP did not listen.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772913" data-originallang="fr"> The bill moved a step forward, but at a snail's pace. It is not that important, then. It was just one step forward. I think I would walk a long, long way for our official languages, but this bill, sadly, goes no farther than a single step. As parliamentarians, this was our chance to take concrete action to reverse the very real decline of French in Canada, and even in Quebec. It is deplorable that official language minority community stakeholders are not being listened to and get nothing but empty words.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772914" data-originallang="fr">I am concerned about the future of Canada as a country bilingual in English and French. We must remember that we have a Governor General who is bilingual but does not speak French. When we talk about bilingualism in Canada, we are referring to the two official languages, the two founding languages.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772915" data-originallang="fr">I was born a francophone in Canada, and my children speak French. I hope that my grandchildren will be able to speak French, here, in Canada. I am proud to be Canadian. I am proud to be a Quebecker. I am proud to represent the people of Portneuf—Jacques‑Cartier. I will fight tooth and nail for francophones in Quebec and across Canada. My ancestors fought that fight and I will continue fighting it. I am proud of our bilingual Canada, and I am not alone: More than 80% of Canadians value their bilingualism.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772916" data-originallang="fr">I want to remind members of one thing. The Official Languages Act was introduced in 1969 and modernized in 1988. Who did that? The Conservatives. The Harper government was the first to recognize the Quebec nation in a united Canada. He understood Quebec and its unique linguistic reality, and he recognized that it was important for the country.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772917" data-originallang="fr">Quebec has the largest pool of francophones in North America, and it must have the tools it needs to preserve its language and culture, which, by extension, will help francophone communities across Canada.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772918" data-originallang="fr">Our leader, the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="291215" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=291215&amp;Language=E">Carleton</a> also values the French language. He is educating his children in French and he speaks both official languages here in the House. He understands the challenges and is making an effort to protect and promote both of Canada's official languages.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772919" data-originallang="fr">In closing, I would again like to reassure the official language minority communities. Unlike the Liberals, we have heard them very clearly and we will call for a single central agency and an enumeration of rights holders. We heard them.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772920" data-originallang="fr">It is truly important to the Conservative Party of Canada that Canada remain an English-French bilingual country, and it will focus on reversing the decline of French and protecting both official languages.</p>

We are making historic investments of $4.1 billion over the next five years.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772922" data-originallang="fr">Second, I listened attentively to my colleague's comments. He said that he listened to what the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada, the Société nationale de l'Acadie and the Société de l'Acadie du Nouveau-Brunswick had to say. I would like to know whether he really paid attention to what they were saying because, over the past six, seven or eight months, stakeholders across the country have been telling us that they are looking forward to the passage of Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a>. They openly and publicly told us that this is a good bill, an ambitious and robust bill.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772923" data-originallang="fr">All of the parties in the House have told us where they stand on this bill except the Conservative Party. Their position is a big mystery.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772924" data-originallang="fr">My question is this. Will the Conservative Party support the bill, yes or no? If my colleague wants to ensure that his grandchildren have the opportunity to talk and live in French, then I think it would be a good idea for the Conservative Party to support the bill.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="7772926" data-originallang="fr">She says that her government has doubled investments since 2015, but that is not the whole issue. Throwing money around, the way the Liberals are used to doing, is not necessarily the solution. We must have tools, such as empowering the Treasury Board as a central agency. It is important to put money into it, but that is not a magic bullet, and it is not a Liberal magic wand.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772927" data-originallang="fr">Now, I do not understand this dogged determination to know a party's position ahead of time. I would like to remind the minister that, according to the procedures of the House, voting is a parliamentary right. If we want to respect House practices, we exercise our right to vote here.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772928" data-originallang="fr">Even if I disagree with her way of doing things, I do appreciate my colleague and I would like to assure her that the Conservative Party will be here to vote.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="7772930" data-originallang="fr">Things were going well at the start, but later there was some manoeuvring on the part of some Liberals, who even voted against the bill yesterday. We could always ask our minister about that.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772931" data-originallang="fr">With regard to the action plan for official languages, we have a government here that says that French is threatened in Quebec but then chooses to subsidize only English in Quebec.

However, the Conservatives have a vision for Canada, while my colleague has a vision for Quebec.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772933" data-originallang="fr">I completely agree with him. It is unacceptable that 20% of the money is going to English-speaking communities in Quebec. English is not under threat in Quebec and across Canada; French is.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772934" data-originallang="fr">What is the proportion of anglophones in Quebec compared to francophone minorities outside Quebec? That would be 8%. Why is the Liberal government giving them 20%?</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772935" data-originallang="fr">If I had to speculate, I would say it was to buy the silence of anglophone MPs from Quebec. It makes me seriously wonder, and I am very much in tune with my Bloc Québécois colleague, whom I want to thank again for the work he did in committee.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="7772937" data-originallang="en">Given that both Liberal and Conservative governments have consistently failed to reach the 4.4% target of francophone immigration, aside from this attempted legislative fix the Liberals are proposing, does my hon. colleague from the Conservatives have any ideas on why successive Conservative and Liberal governments have failed to reach that target?

I would remind my colleague that this Liberal government has been in office since 2015. I cannot answer for them.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772939" data-originallang="fr">The Liberals met the target this year, probably with the help of their marketing firm, making sure that they got good press and that everyone knew they met their immigration target.

	<p data-HoCid="7772940" data-originallang="fr">I want my colleague to know that we are going to do everything we can, once we are on the other side of the House, to ensure that official languages and the decline of French are a government priority.</p>

<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-13,3" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="An Act for the Substantive Equality of Canada's Official Languages" data-intervention-type="Debate" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278438" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. Bernard Généreux (Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup, CPC)" data-timestamp="2023-05-12 10:45:00" id="12211569"><p data-HoCid="7772941" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate my colleague, with whom I sit as a member of the Standing Committee on Official Languages, as well as all the parties who worked on Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C‑13</a> in committee. The committee members worked for some time on studying the bill.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772942" data-originallang="fr">I sincerely think that my colleague did extraordinary work and that we did everything we could to improve this bill, unlike the coalition between the NDP and the Liberal Party, who prevented us from adopting certain amendments. Despite that, I think that we did good work.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772943" data-originallang="fr">I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C‑13</a>, an act to amend the Official Languages Act, to enact the use of French in federally regulated private businesses act and to make related amendments to other acts. We are now studying the bill at third reading after having studied it in committee. The way I see this legislation and the entire process for the final adoption of this bill is that it is a lot of effort for little result. We did a colossal job and in the end we do not have much to show for it. That is about the size of it. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772944" data-originallang="fr">Some will say that it is better than nothing. Of course it is better than nothing, but this bill does not go far enough. In committee, this Liberal government tabled no fewer than 31 amendments. It was actually more than 31. Even yesterday, the Liberals tabled amendments in the House. Clearly, they were not prepared despite all the work they said they did beforehand on the previous bill, which was introduced before the 2021 election, and on the white paper. In passing, the white paper set out some extremely important elements, which, unfortunately, were not kept in the bill.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772945" data-originallang="fr">The fact that a government tabled so many amendments to a bill that it drafted demonstrates how poorly thought-out it was. With the complicity of their faithful allies, the NDP, the Liberals imposed closure so this bill would be studied quickly. The closure motion stated that, after a certain amount of time, all the amendments would be deemed adopted by the committee without them even being studied. So much for respecting the work of parliamentarians in committee.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772946" data-originallang="fr">The bill ignores the requests for amendments made by the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadiennes, or FCFA, and the Commissioner of Official Languages. Their requests are not found in the final text of the bill. We were not given the time we needed to discuss them properly. The FCFA is the organization that brings together the largest number of associations and organizations representing francophones in Canada. It had only six requests; it did not put forward 80 of them. Not a single one of the FCFA's requests ended up in the bill.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772947" data-originallang="fr">I could spend hours naming the problems with this bill, but I will concentrate on a few points on which we put forward amendments. Our party put them forward in good faith to give the bill more teeth and to give organizations the necessary tools to slow the decline of the French language in Canada. Unfortunately, those amendments were all voted down by the NDP-Liberal coalition.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772948" data-originallang="fr">We tabled amendments regarding the power given to the Treasury Board.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772949" data-originallang="fr">The Official Languages Act has been around for over 50 years. We have seen the result. French is in decline everywhere, not just in Canada but also in Quebec. It has been proven that the way the act is designed, but especially the way it is managed, structured and overseen, is not working. Everyone was unanimous on the proposal made by many organizations across Canada. Even the Liberals were on board in the beginning. In their white paper, they said that the central agency of the Treasury Board would be responsible for enforcing the act. Unfortunately, that is not what we are seeing and that is not what is going to happen in the current bill. That is really unfortunate.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772950" data-originallang="fr">The bill as it now stands contains a provision to change the act every 10 years, unlike how it was before. There is a provision that says that we can review the bill every 10 years. We suggested that it should be every five years, but our amendment was once again defeated.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772951" data-originallang="fr">That said, these 10 years should give us enough time to examine and verify whether it would have been feasible to make a central agency responsible for implementing the act. Ten years will be enough time to check whether making the Treasury Board the lead for implementing the bill would have worked. We could have made changes after 10 years, but no, a decision was made to stick with the same approach.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772952" data-originallang="fr">Despite what the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278926" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278926&amp;Language=E">Minister of Official Languages</a> said, the Treasury Board leads the only three agencies that have the binding authority needed to address violations of the act.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772953" data-originallang="fr">We tabled amendments to that effect, and the majority of francophone organizations also made this request, but they were all rejected.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772954" data-originallang="fr">We made concessions, proposed amendments to the amendments in order to reach a compromise, but again, they were flatly refused. In my mind, that confirms the lack of desire to make this bill more effective.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772955" data-originallang="fr">With respect to the enumeration of rights holders, another very important element is that Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C‑13</a>, in its current form, does not ensure that all children of rights holders will continue to be counted under section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772956" data-originallang="fr">As set out in the act, rights holders are divided into three categories of individuals who have the right to send their children to official language minority public elementary and secondary schools. This right allows the children of rights holders to preserve their mother tongue and retain their constitutionally guaranteed rights.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772957" data-originallang="fr">Currently, the government is only obligated to estimate the number of rights holders, and that was the subject of much discussion. We proposed including a question to this effect in the census, but it was rejected. This will unfortunately lead to an underestimation of the number of children of rights holders.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772958" data-originallang="fr">As for reviewing the legislation, we proposed that Bill C-13 be reviewed every five years. As I said earlier, unfortunately, that too was rejected. At least it is going to happen every 10 years. As I said earlier, we did a tremendous amount of work but have very little to show for it. The 10-year period is part of that. Once again, it is better than nothing.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772959" data-originallang="fr">The same goes for the powers granted to the Commissioner of Official Languages. We wanted to increase the commissioner's power and give him the tools needed to enforce the act with businesses and federal agencies. The problem is that it means the federal government might have to fine federal agencies. It is important to understand that, here in Ottawa and in all government organizations across the country, several agencies and departments are not meeting their official languages obligations, especially in writing. The government is still sending English-only messages across Canada, on many platforms. There is no translation.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772960" data-originallang="fr">With our amendments, the commissioner would have been able to crack down on this and do his job more effectively, but once again, the NDP-Liberal coalition did not want to enhance the commissioner's powers.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772961" data-originallang="fr">The last thing that could have been improved, but was not, also concerns part VII of the act. We wanted to include obligations to ensure that federal institutions would implement more measures to protect and promote both official languages. This country was founded 150 years ago, and there were two founding peoples. After all these years, one might think it would be second nature to communicate in both languages, but even today some departments communicate only in English. That is completely unacceptable.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772962" data-originallang="fr">Clearly, Bill C‑13, which we are debating today, is incomplete and has several flaws. The powers of the commissioner were not strengthened, there is no central agency to enforce the act and the act will not be reviewed every five years to keep it up to date.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772963" data-originallang="fr">After eight years of this government, it is difficult to trust that it will stop the decline of French in order to protect the strength of both official languages.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772964" data-originallang="fr">Again, I want to thank my colleague and colleagues because the Standing Committee on Official Languages may be the least partisan of all the House of Commons committees. Honestly, I have been a member of that committee for a long time. We have done some absolutely spectacular studies that are very interesting and very instructive at that committee.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772965" data-originallang="fr">The process involved in Bill C‑13 was derived from its primary objective, which was to improve the legislation and come to a consensus among all parties to ensure that we have the best Official Languages Act possible in Canada. Unfortunately, that did not happen. However, fortunately, in 10 years, we will be able to review it. When a majority Conservative government is in power in the next few months or next year, we will review the act when the time comes to do so.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="7772967" data-originallang="fr">I would like to hear his opinion. We know that the House of Commons recognized Quebec as a nation with one official and common language, French. We know that, in the beginning, language was supposed to fall under Quebec's jurisdiction. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772968" data-originallang="fr">What does my colleague think about the Government of Quebec's request to have authority over linguistic development and management in the province, while respecting the rights of the anglophone community, obviously?</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772969" data-originallang="fr">With regard to positive measures, what does he think about the action plan that we have seen that invests a massive amount of money in English in areas under provincial jurisdiction?</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772970" data-originallang="fr">I also would like to know whether he agrees that we should review the act before the 10 years is up, because, although I think that this bill does make some progress, it will continue to have an anglicizing impact on Quebec.</p>
	</div>
<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-13,3" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="An Act for the Substantive Equality of Canada's Official Languages" data-intervention-type="Interjection" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278438" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. Bernard Généreux" data-timestamp="2023-05-12 10:55:00" id="12211588"><p data-HoCid="7772971" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, to answer the last question my colleague asked, because he asked several, yes, a Conservative government would review the act, likely within 10 years. We believe that a central agency is absolutely fundamental to managing official languages in this country. Our leader, the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278241" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278241&amp;Language=E">Carleton</a>, has said very clearly that the act is not strong enough and does not go far enough and, most importantly, that there is no central agency to ensure compliance.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772972" data-originallang="fr">I also want to talk about the division that we have been seeing on the Liberal side. In fact, yesterday, one Liberal member abstained from voting on the Liberal bill, and another voted against it. Anglophone MPs from Quebec have been working hard to derail the process of passing this bill. It was unmistakably clear that the Liberal Party of Canada is divided.</p>

He is doing a great job.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772974" data-originallang="fr">The minister said she has a great relationship with Quebec's minister of the French language, Mr. Roberge. That is interesting because I saw Mr. Roberge make a statement about the massive investment in Quebec's anglophones. I would like to hear my colleague's thoughts on that.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="7772976" data-originallang="fr">Once again, it was a game of ping-pong between the two ministers, one in Quebec and one in Ottawa, who could not come to an agreement. That is pretty much what happened. The day before yesterday they were once again patting each other on the back while holding a falcon. Maybe they will be less happy three months from now, I have no idea, but one thing is certain. We in the Conservative Party will listen to Quebec, and we will solve this bill's problems in the future.</p>

Since 1994, Darcy and Manjit have both been actively volunteering in the community and have made a significant difference in people’s lives. They are or have been involved with the Langley Memorial Hospital Foundation, Langley Meals on Wheels, BC Children’s Hospital Foundation, the B.C. Cancer Society, and the list goes on. Even right now, every week, Manjit delivers meals to students at HD Stafford Middle School. Our community is very grateful to this couple.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7772999" data-originallang="en"> I congratulate Darcy and Manjit on this recent recognition. Their work makes our community a better place.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773000" data-originallang="en">I would like to take this opportunity to wish all moms, including mine, a happy Mother's Day.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="7773002" data-originallang="en">Heart Lake Road divides a conservation area from a marshy wetland. With an increase in traffic, the community noticed a spike in deaths of wildlife on the road. This, of course, prompted Leo into action. He recruited a team of volunteers to do the arduous task of gathering data by tracking how many and what type of amphibians and other animals were being killed by vehicles. This involved even having to scrape dead turtles off the road and meticulously catalogue them. This sad and often gruesome task played a vital role in understanding the impact on the local ecology, which led to the approval of the installation of an eco fence, a huge victory for Leo and the team of turtle troopers, but also for Bramptonians.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773003" data-originallang="en">As a community, we are fortunate to have someone like Leo. I want to commend him for his hard work, his passion and his unwavering commitment to the environment. I hope his example will inspire others to take action to protect our planet. </p>

It is a day to appreciate the hard work and the sacrifices mothers make to raise their children and maintain their households. The day also recognizes the many different forms of motherhood, including stepmothers, foster mothers, adoptive mothers and grandmothers. Mother's Day is essential because it promotes gratitude, respect and love towards the most important women in our lives and strengthens the family bond. It is also an opportunity to reflect on the importance of maternal figures and the impact they have on our society.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773005" data-originallang="en">On a personal note, it is a day when I reflect on the love of my family: my children, who have made me the woman I am today and have given me a reason to fight for this country.

Happy Mother's Day.”</p>

Across Canada, so many people have lost their loved ones to the toxic drug crisis. In the past six years, nearly 25,000 Canadians have died of apparent overdoses. Moms Stop the Harm is fighting back, in the name of the precious children they have lost, using all that pain to take action for every opportunity to save a life.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773023" data-originallang="en">A recent report by the Mental Health Commission of Canada and the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction found that fewer than one in four people with problematic substance use accessed services.

Quebec is also called the heart of the francophonie in North America.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773264" data-originallang="fr">I hope that this is a sign that awareness is growing in English Canada and that it reinvigorates a movement of affirmation of the francophone and Acadian communities and a movement of national liberation in Quebec. To ensure the future of our language, our culture and what makes us a unique people, we must be freed from the yoke of a federal policy that prevents us from making French the official and common language and from exercising our right to self-determination.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773265" data-originallang="fr">It is vital to know the past in order to understand the present. To find our way in the future, we also need to know our history. That is why I am going to talk a little bit about the Official Languages Act first and then move on to Bill C‑13 and what we still have to accomplish in the future if we really want to secure our future and counter the decline of French.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773266" data-originallang="fr">Quebec poet and politician Gérald Godin, whom one of my NDP colleagues quoted recently, said this in 1983:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7773267" data-originallang="fr"> The federal policy on French in Canada can generally be summarized as follows: strengthen French where it is on its last legs; remain passive where there are real chances for it to assert itself and weaken it where it is strong. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7773268" data-originallang="fr">Unfortunately, that is still true today.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773269" data-originallang="fr">After a majority of francophones outside Quebec were assimilated by measures taken in all the Canadian provinces, by laws and regulations that outlawed teaching French in school and using it in provincial legislatures, the government of the Canadian majority adopted legislation designed to strengthen English in Quebec and provide not quite enough support for francophone and Acadian communities to stave off their gradual anglicization.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773270" data-originallang="fr">The Official Languages Act primarily seeks to support English in Quebec because Pierre Elliott Trudeau decided that the federal government would support official language minorities in each province, and coincidentally, in Quebec, that is the anglophones. He refused to support André Laurendeau, who proposed special status for Quebec. To Mr. Laurendeau, that was essential. He looked to the Belgian and Swiss models, which are based on the principle of territoriality, but Mr. Trudeau rejected this proposal because of his anti-nationalist ideology.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773271" data-originallang="fr">The territoriality-based approach corresponds to one of the two major language policy models in the world. It seeks to establish an official and common language on a given territory. In contrast, the Official Languages Act is based on the principle of personality or, in other words, it is a policy of institutional bilingualism that seeks to give individuals the right to choose French or English. That is why we say that this type of policy encourages people to choose the language of the majority under the principle of personality.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773272" data-originallang="fr"> Guillaume Rousseau, a professor of language law in Quebec, said that “virtually all language policy experts around the world believe that only a territoriality-based approach can guarantee the survival and development of a minority language”. Based on the principle of personality, the Official Languages Act seeks to impose English as the official language in Quebec.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773273" data-originallang="fr">The other main principle underlying the Official Languages Act is the presumed symmetry or equivalence between anglophones in Quebec and the francophone and Acadian minorities. Such symmetry made no sense from the start. It contradicted the scientific observations of the Laurendeau-Dunton commission, which established that, even in Quebec, francophones were disadvantaged from both an economic and institutional perspective.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773274" data-originallang="fr">Francophone workers ranked 12th out of 14 linguistic groups in terms of income. The economic status of francophones in Quebec did subsequently improve. It has come a long way, though not all the way. According to Statistics Canada data, in 2016, the average income of all full-time workers with French as their mother tongue was $7,820 less than that of anglophones.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773275" data-originallang="fr">There are all sorts of debates, but when we take indicators that are less sensitive to income disparities and that include, for example, a large proportion of immigrants, of course we come up with different results. The fact remains that members of the historical English-speaking community still occupy a very favourable position.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773276" data-originallang="fr">While laws prohibiting French schools did not apply in Quebec, French-language education has long been underfunded and severely restricted in areas such as Pontiac. It is particularly appalling that, in those days, the Official Languages Act and the official languages in education program were designed to support English almost exclusively in Quebec. The injustice was even more blatant for the francophone and Acadian communities that had suffered when French schools were banned.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773277" data-originallang="fr">A study by the Commission nationale des parents francophones showed that, between 1970 and 1988, anglophones in Quebec received 47%, or $1.1 billion, of the total funding available through the Government of Canada's official languages program for anglophone educational institutions. English second-language instruction in Quebec received 9.5%, and 14.5% went to immersion schools outside Quebec. The Commission nationale des parents francophones said that it was truly astonished to realize that 71.5% of the funds ultimately went to the majority. Only 28.5% of the funds were allocated to French first-language instruction outside Quebec. In the meantime, as the commission's report mentions, a significant number of francophones in every province except Quebec were still being denied access to education in their language and were being assimilated at breakneck speed.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773278" data-originallang="fr">In his statement on official languages, Pierre Elliott Trudeau said that “French-speaking Canadians outside of Quebec should have the same rights as English-speaking Canadians in Quebec”. However, his official languages in education program did just the opposite. It reinforced the privileged position of Quebec anglophones and generally left francophone educational institutions outside Quebec sorely disadvantaged.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773279" data-originallang="fr">Today, federal funding is more evenly distributed among the provinces, but the majority of funding continues to go to immersion schools outside Quebec. In Quebec, funding continues to be allocated almost exclusively to English schools.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773280" data-originallang="fr">According to census data, Quebec anglophones appear to exhibit more of the characteristics of a majority than a minority in terms of their linguistic vitality. While mother-tongue anglophones represented 8.8% of the population in Quebec in 2021, 43.3% of allophones chose to speak English at home. English's share of overall gains through assimilation is 50.8%.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773281" data-originallang="fr">With just under 50% of immigrants choosing to speak French at home in 2021, the proportion of francophones continues to decline in Quebec, as well as in Canada as a whole. We would need about 90% of immigrants to speak French at home just to maintain the demographic weight of francophones in Quebec. This corresponds to the relative demographic weight of francophones and anglophones.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773282" data-originallang="fr">It is not surprising that all of the projection studies that have been done point in the same direction, that is, the decline of French. In 2021, not only did Statistics Canada confirmed this trend, but the results also show that the decline of French in Quebec has been underestimated.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773283" data-originallang="fr">Let us recall the founding principles of the Official Languages Act. I spoke earlier about one of them, the principle of the minority status of anglophones, which does not take scientific data into account. At first glance, we can see that this principle is completely ludicrous in terms of political and legal power. As long as Quebec stays within Canada, it will be subject to the will of the Canadian majority, which is anglophone and which elects the federal government, with its predominant legislative and spending power. That is what we are seeing here.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773284" data-originallang="fr">In 1982, the federal government and the anglophone provinces imposed a Constitution on Quebec that has never been endorsed by any Quebec government, and pursuant to which the most important enforcement measures of the Charter of the French Language were weakened. Let us recall that 74 of the 75 Quebec MPs were Liberals and that all but one of them voted in favour of that. That speaks volumes about the objective of the Liberal Party at the time.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773285" data-originallang="fr">In an opinion requested by stakeholders on the language of commercial signs in Quebec, the UN Human Rights Committee affirmed in 1993 that English-speaking citizens of Canada cannot be considered a linguistic minority because they are part of the Canadian majority. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773286" data-originallang="fr">I have compiled data from the public accounts of Canada. It shows beyond any doubt that the vast majority of funds allocated to Quebec contribute to anglicization and strengthen the so-called anglophone minority. More than 95% of this funding is allocated to English in Quebec. Since 1969, more than $3.4 billion has been allocated for English in Quebec, even though the anglophone community was already in a privileged situation with overfunded institutions. This only increased its advantage. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773287" data-originallang="fr">In several areas, such as post-secondary education and health and social services, English institutions are also significantly overfunded by the Quebec government. In addition to programs that support the official languages, the federal government heavily overfunds English institutions, such as universities and health care facilities, through its infrastructure projects and research funds. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773288" data-originallang="fr">As Frédéric Lacroix has pointed out, the institutional network is a zero-sum game. The anglophone and francophone networks both serve the same population and are both funded from the same budget. What one group gets, the other must do without. Several anglophone lobby groups have said it is not a zero-sum game, but if anyone tries to touch their budget, all of a sudden it does become a zero-sum game, and they react quite aggressively.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773289" data-originallang="fr">In 2017, nearly 40% of federal university funding went to English universities. This institutional overfunding of anglophone establishments contributes significantly to the anglicization of newcomers, including allophones and even an increasing number of francophones in Quebec.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773290" data-originallang="fr">The federal language policy can be regarded as the blind spot in Quebec's language debate. Rather than challenging the Quebec government directly by constantly opposing its efforts to make French the common public language, the feds prefer to encourage anglophone lobby groups to form. It has even helped shape and finance them. These organizations intervene to weaken the Charter of the French Language through legal challenges funded by the federal court challenges program, which was established, coincidentally, in 1978, after Bill 101 was enacted.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773291" data-originallang="fr">These organizations have a very important impact. We must not minimize that. For example, they constantly favour services in English and institutional bilingualism, which makes it really difficult for the Government of Quebec to make French the common and official language.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773292" data-originallang="fr">For example, when speaking in support of French signage, René Lévesque said that, in a way, every bilingual sign tells immigrants that there are two languages in Quebec, French and English, and that they can choose whichever one they like. It tells anglophones that they do not need to learn French because everything is translated. We saw it with the official languages action plan. This is still happening.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773293" data-originallang="fr">The government really needs to rethink that funding. We saw it with the support of federal institutions that define anglophones using the criterion of first official language spoken, which includes 33% of immigrants. These organizations work to diminish the place of francophones with the support of the federal government. We also know that the Quebec Community Groups Network, or QCGN, and the 40-some organizations that are directly affiliated with it often use speech that blames francophones and victimizes anglophones. Josée Legault referred to this as xenophobic speech, and it is very effective in influencing the public opinion of the anglophone majority in Canada and abroad.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773294" data-originallang="fr">We saw many examples of just that in the challenge to Bill 96 and here in the debates over Bill C-13. The member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278383" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278383&amp;Language=E">Mount Royal</a> showed up with opinions that essentially echoed those of the QCGN. This former president of Alliance Quebec argues that services in English for English-speaking immigrants are a fundamental right. We also saw another <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278367" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278367&amp;Language=E">member</a> repeat the QCGN's disinformation, which said that Bill 96 aims to prohibit health services in English, which is absolutely not true.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773295" data-originallang="fr">The fact remains that there are positive aspects to Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a>, which acknowledges that “Quebec's Charter of the French Language provides that French is the official language of Quebec” and that “the goal...is to protect, strengthen and promote that language”. In addition, there were all the last-minute amendments, following a compromise between the Quebec and Canadian governments to amend the new law on the use of French within federally regulated private businesses. Those amendments included significant changes in favour of the asymmetry between French and English.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773296" data-originallang="fr">These amendments ensure that the federal legislation incorporates several clauses inspired by the Charter of the French Language, such as generalizing the use of French at all levels of a business. There are other clauses that aim to protect the right to work in French in Quebec. It is an asymmetrical measure that applies in Quebec and in regions with a strong concentration of francophones, which corresponds to the territorial model Bill 101 was based on. It could also apply in other regions, alongside other language planning models for francophones outside Quebec. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773297" data-originallang="fr">Since culture and the French language are at the heart of what makes Quebec a nation, the Bloc Québécois is working very hard and being pragmatic to achieve every possible gain. The recognition of the Charter of the French Language and the asymmetrical elements included in Bill C‑13 represent as much progress as we believe possible for the time being. That is why the Bloc Québécois will be voting in favour of Bill C‑13. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773298" data-originallang="fr">The fact remains that the Official Languages Act will continue to exert an anglicizing influence on Quebec. We will continue to work to amend the Official Languages Act to make it no longer apply to Quebec, so that we can truly make French our common and official language. We will take the Official Languages Act out of the blind spot where it hides in public debate in Quebec.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773299" data-originallang="fr">I think people will have to face facts: Unless we get results fast, the only solution is for Quebec to become its own country.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="7773302" data-originallang="fr">I have a specific question for my colleague.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773303" data-originallang="fr">Recently, we have seen great collaboration between the federal and Quebec governments. It has been unprecedented, especially on the official languages file. Minister Roberge and I worked very hard to reach an agreement on the issue of federally regulated private businesses. Jean-François Lisée said he never thought the federal and Quebec governments would reach an agreement.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773304" data-originallang="fr">Could my colleague talk a little about what he thinks of the great collaboration between Ottawa and the Government of Quebec?</p>

I hope she will be as co-operative, so that the action plan for official languages ​​supports this asymmetry that is recognized in the law on the use of French in federally regulated private businesses.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773306" data-originallang="fr"> Even Quebec's minister of the French language was surprised that there were no measures for French in this bill. We were talking about $137.5 million allocated to projects already identified to support English in Quebec. That is more than $800 million over four years. I think it is unacceptable to continue funding English in Quebec when the government has recognized that it is the French language that is under threat. I hope the minister will be open to the idea of ​​making the action plan and the principles set out in the bill more consistent. We are going to work very hard on that.</p>

I had the pleasure of working rigorously with him to improve Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a>. I would like to thank him for mentioning Gérald Godin. I think if someone were to dive into my family tree, they would likely find a connection between him and I in terms of passion for official languages and French, but not so much when it comes to our respective views on independence.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773316" data-originallang="fr">I would like to ask an initial question related to what we saw in committee. I would like to hear my colleague's comments on the NDP's attitude, it being a member of the NDP-Liberal coalition. The NDP members prevented the bill from being improved. One thing they refused to do was to give all of the powers proposed in the bill to the Treasury Board as a central agency, as well as the rights holders. I think it is important to count the rights holders outside of Quebec rather than simply estimating their numbers.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773317" data-originallang="fr">My second question is along the same lines as the Minister of Official Languages. What are my colleague's thoughts on the disappointment that Minister Roberge expressed when he discovered that far too much money was being given to English-speaking minorities in Quebec, when the common language of this province is French and English in Quebec is not in decline?</p>
	</div>
<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-13,3" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="An Act for the Substantive Equality of Canada's Official Languages" data-intervention-type="Interjection" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278678" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. Mario Beaulieu" data-timestamp="2023-05-12 12:40:00" id="12212125"><p data-HoCid="7773318" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague. We did indeed work well with him. I think we have done everything possible in the circumstances. We could have gone farther, by naming the Treasury Board as the central agency in charge of implementation, for instance. Many of the amendments sought by the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne, the FCFA, fell by the wayside. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773319" data-originallang="fr">The Liberal-NDP coalition seems to have been fairly effective, although I concede that the NDP supported the amendments we managed to table, because it took the combined efforts of all the opposition parties. However, we could have gone a lot farther. The NDP's Sherbrooke declaration and support for Quebeckers' self-determination did not seem to count for much during the committee debates. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773320" data-originallang="fr">To get back to Minister Roberge, I think the people of Quebec made their own calculations. It was not what they had asked for. They wanted control of language planning and wanted the Charter of the French Language to take precedence. They even suggested excluding the concept of an anglophone minority altogether. Although they did not get these things, they still secured significant changes in the Official Languages Act in relation to federally regulated businesses.</p>

What he did not mention, of course, is that the NDP is the only political party in Canada that promotes the French language in the provinces it governs and here in the House of Commons.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773322" data-originallang="fr">As the member well knows, in British Columbia, it was an NDP government that put in place the network of primary, secondary and post-secondary schools throughout the province. More and more children are studying in French throughout their school years.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773323" data-originallang="fr">Although the sad history of francophone rights in Canada, which the member for La Pointe-de-l'Île mentioned, is true, it is in the past. Today, we are seeing more and more progress. I am rather optimistic about the future of our beautiful language, because I see that, in the coming years, there will be 500 million francophones in the world.</p>

However, I would like to point out that post-secondary education in French is broadly lacking in western Canada. Some huge challenges remain, which is preventing western Canada from having decent French-language educational institutions.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773326" data-originallang="fr">I want to point something out regarding the right to self-determination. If Quebec is considered a nation, it should have control over what makes it a nation and over its language. The Charter of the French language should take precedence over the Official Languages ​​Act. We should have a say in the hundreds of millions of dollars in grants that are awarded to support English. The NDP has not always supported these proposals, but it has supported some of them.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="7773328" data-originallang="fr">Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> contains some good measures for Acadians and francophones outside Quebec. We welcome that, and we support it. For the first time, the government is recognizing that French is under threat, including in Quebec. That is a first, so we applaud it. However, at the same time that the government is saying that French is threatened in Quebec, it is spending $800 million on English to encourage the anglicization of Quebec.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773329" data-originallang="fr">Does that not expose the utter hypocrisy of the Liberal government?</p>
	</div>
<div class="statement" data-bill-stage="C-13,3" data-h1="Government Orders" data-h2="An Act for the Substantive Equality of Canada's Official Languages" data-intervention-type="Interjection" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278678" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. Mario Beaulieu" data-timestamp="2023-05-12 12:45:00" id="12212135"><p data-HoCid="7773330" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I could not have put it better myself. The Bloc Québécois certainly supports francophone and Acadian communities. We think what has been happening for the past few years is totally unacceptable. There was a strategy that led to the presentation of action plans on official languages that promoted that. Again, it is the same thing.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773331" data-originallang="fr">A journalist asked a question and a senior official answered on condition of anonymity. That is how we were able to find out that $800 million was going to be allocated to English in Quebec. I found out because I combed through the public accounts. I think that Quebeckers do not agree with this. Francophones from Quebec do not agree, and we are going to make it known. If we get enough people to rally behind the Government of Quebec and the Bloc Québécois, the federal government is going to have to change this. Otherwise, as I said, we will soon have to resume marching toward Quebec's independence.</p>

This bill has our unequivocal support. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773333" data-originallang="fr">Today is a historic day. No changes have been made to the Official Languages Act for 30 years, but we finally managed to do it. The work was sometimes hard, but it was important for the francophonie, Quebec, Acadia, Franco-Manitobans and all of the other francophone communities across the country.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773334" data-originallang="fr">On a personal level, it is important for me, for my children, for all of our children and for our future. I am a proud francophile. I was born in Thompson, in northern Manitoba. I am the daughter of immigrant parents. My mother tongue is not English or French. It is Greek. I understand how lucky I am. My parents understood the importance of speaking both of Canada's official languages, and it is thanks to the battle waged by francophones across the country, teachers and allies, that I had the opportunity to study French through a French immersion program.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773335" data-originallang="fr">In Manitoba, many francophones fought for their rights and for public investment in French education. In the 1980s, a Manitoba NDP government, of which my father, Steve Ashton, was a member, fought against discrimination and defended the right of francophones to have access to services and legislation in their language.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773336" data-originallang="fr">I knew from a young age that we cannot take anything for granted. We have to fight to move forward. I also know that generations of young Canadians are able to communicate in our two official languages thanks to the dedication of our teachers, our schools and our communities and, above all, their passion for the French language.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773337" data-originallang="fr">In my last speech, I paid tribute to almost every teacher that my generation of students and I had at our immersion school, Riverside School, in Thompson. It was through teachers, particularly in my immersion experience, that we learned not only French, but also about francophone culture. We now have unique insight and a richer understanding of our country and our world.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773338" data-originallang="fr">I want the same thing for my two children, Stefanos and Leonidas. They are now five and a half years old. They are in kindergarten at École La Voie du Nord, a French-language school in the Division scolaire franco-manitobaine, or DSFM, in Thompson. My children are part of the next generation. For them, the world has become a little smaller, but it is a world where French is in decline in Canada. We must stop this decline and fight for this next generation.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773339" data-originallang="fr">I want to point out that the work we did in committee was historic work. I am proud of what we accomplished at this committee. I want to mention a few important changes that we made to Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> to strengthen it and to better address the decline of French in our country.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773340" data-originallang="fr">First, I want to mention that changes were made to the bill concerning immigration. We must ensure that we have ambitious targets that recognize that we must accept francophone immigrants and francophone families to enrich our communities across the country and address the decline of French.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773341" data-originallang="fr">I recognize that this is also a priority in the government's action plan, but let us remember that ambitious targets are not enough. We also need to invest in consular services, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. We need to invest in settlement services here in Canada, and we need to ensure that we have a well-organized and carefully targeted system to recruit the people that we need. I especially want to emphasize the recruitment of early childhood, elementary, secondary and post-secondary educators.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773342" data-originallang="fr">The reality is that there is a major shortage of French teachers both in immersion and in the francophone network outside Quebec. We need to find solutions to this labour shortage. We need to acknowledge that the Canadian Association of Immersion Professionals has said that an extra 10,000 teachers are needed to meet the current demand for French immersion and French as a second language.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773343" data-originallang="fr">How are we going to resolve these labour shortages and attract the professionals we need to maintain public services in French-language and immersion schools and day cares? We need to strive to meet the ambitious targets in Bill C‑13 with targeted investments and with a real plan to welcome the people we need to be able to educate the next generation of young people in French across the country.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773344" data-originallang="fr">I have to say that this is personal for me. I have mentioned in committee several times that my own children were on a waiting list for more than a year to get a spot at a French day care in my community because of the labour shortage. Many efforts were made to resolve this problem, including an initiative to bring people with early childhood education experience to Canada. Despite all these efforts, the problem could not be resolved. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada did not provide enough help. The result is that several children, including my own, were unable to attend day care in French.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773345" data-originallang="fr">We have to be able to make these crucial investments in education in order to educate the next generation in French.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773346" data-originallang="fr">This step forward in the bill is also linked to one of the other changes we were able to make, of which I am very proud. It was the NDP that pushed to include the negotiation of mandatory language clauses in agreements between the provinces and the federal government. Our aim is to ensure that every agreement between the federal government and the provinces includes language clauses so funding can be given to francophone and anglophone minority communities, to ensure they receive their fair share. Be it for health care, employment services or day care, we absolutely need to include language clauses in our agreements with the provinces to ensure that francophone and anglophone minority communities have access to adequate services and opportunities.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773347" data-originallang="fr">I would also like to point out that we were able to make changes to increase the Treasury Board's powers regarding the enforcement of Bill C‑13. We were also able to give more powers to the Commissioner of Official Languages. We were able to make changes that a number of stakeholders had requested, particularly with respect to access to justice. I would like to mention that Manitoba's francophone jurists clearly indicated that Bill C‑13 should address the importance of access to justice in French and ensure that Manitoba francophones can go to court in French. Of course, the same right will apply to English-speaking minority communities. With all our colleagues around the table, we were able to ensure that people will have access to justice in French outside Quebec in provinces like Manitoba.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773348" data-originallang="fr">I would also like to talk about another change we made. We insisted on the issue of access to federal lands for francophone school districts.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773349" data-originallang="fr">This is something of utmost importance for many school boards that need to grow to meet increasing demand yet do not have the space to do so. Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> provides that opportunity.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773350" data-originallang="fr">Finally, I am very proud of the work we have been able to do. I want to once again recognize organizations like the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne, or FCFA, and its president, Liane Roy. The FCFA is the national voice of 2.8 million French-speaking Canadians living in nine provinces and three territories. It represents the voice of francophones across Canada. It has played a key role and was crucial in ensuring that the President of the Treasury Board would have greater responsibility for implementing Bill C‑13 and that francophone immigration will be supported. It is also thanks to that organization that we pushed further on the issue of language clauses and succeeded in giving more powers to the Commissioner of Official Languages.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773351" data-originallang="fr">I also want to recognize the work of the FCFA member organizations working on the ground, including here in Manitoba. They are the true defenders of the French language. I want to commend them for their hard work on Bill C‑13.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773352" data-originallang="fr">The last major reform of the Official Languages Act was in 1988. It was clear that there were gaps in the act. It was not easy for our youth to receive all their education in French, from early childhood to post-secondary education. There was a lack of francophone staff. Access to justice in French was difficult. Emergency alerts and information on health and public safety were not available in French.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773353" data-originallang="fr">I believe that Bill C‑13 is a big step in the right direction. I want to acknowledge the committee's cooperation during our work. I want to thank all the committee members who moved amendments to the bill. I know that we did not always see eye to eye, but we all had the same goal of protecting the French language in Canada and defending the rights of official language minority communities in Canada. The amendments that were adopted by the committee are essential. We hope that the Senate will respect them.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773354" data-originallang="fr"> The reality is that this bill will change the federal government approach by recognizing that French is a minority language throughout Canada and North America. The government's actions will have to reflect that.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773355" data-originallang="fr">We must recognize that the sharp decline in the number of francophones in Canada is a serious problem and that we must take action in whatever way we can. We are all familiar with the statistics. The French language is in decline across our country. In 1971, the demographic weight of francophones was 25.5%; today, it is less than 23%. If we do not defend our services and institutions, if we do not defend French education in French and immersion schools, the decline will continue.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773356" data-originallang="fr">Today, we are moving forward with a national project, a project rooted in the recognition of first peoples and indigenous languages. It is a project that recognizes our two official languages and the fact that we must work to protect French in Canada. It is a project that recognizes the diversity of our country, the multiculturalism of our country. It is a project that recognizes the fact that there are many Canadians like me, whose parents came from other countries and who want to raise their families and contribute to our country in both official languages, perhaps even in their mother tongue, and thus contribute to a bilingual country, a multicultural country, a country that respects the first peoples of Canada.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773357" data-originallang="fr">I strongly encourage all my colleagues in the House to vote in favour of this historic bill so we can continue the work needed to defend French and support official language minority communities.</p>

As she so rightly pointed out, everyone worked really hard to send this bill back to the House, and here we are. All of the official language minority communities are asking that Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> be passed as quickly as possible. We recently commenced a study on francophone immigration, more specifically francophone immigration from Africa.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773359" data-originallang="fr">My colleague and I do not have access to French child care, so I would like her to explain how important it is to identify the needs of our communities. Bill C-13 provides for the adoption of a francophone immigration policy, and we established a threshold of recovery to 1971 levels.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773360" data-originallang="fr">How important is it to identify the needs of our communities and how will Bill C-13 help with that?</p>

We believe that the 4.4% target does not go far enough. We agree with the stakeholders, like the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada, or FCFA, who have said as much. We need an ambitious plan to support our communities.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773363" data-originallang="fr">As my colleague said, specific areas need to be targeted, areas like education, including early childhood education. We need to ensure that the necessary work is done in this country to recruit, educate and support French-language educators. However, let us be honest. We also have to welcome people from outside Canada to help fill these jobs. These people must be able to come here to contribute to Canada and benefit from the advantages of living here, as many immigrant families have done, including mine.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773364" data-originallang="fr">We hope that Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C-13</a> will mark the beginning of a new chapter.

Indeed, we are unanimous and we have all worked towards the same goal, albeit in different ways.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773366" data-originallang="fr">My colleague said she was proud of the result. I, for one, think we only got half the job done. We could have done a lot more, even though, as the saying goes, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It had been a long time since the legislation had been modernized, so we should have used more aggressive means to obtain more immediate results.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773367" data-originallang="fr">I had the opportunity to work with my colleague. In her speech, she often talked about access to education, but there is one amendment in particular on which I would like to hear her opinion. Why did she vote with the Liberals on the enumeration of rights holders?</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773368" data-originallang="fr">This is important because it gives us much more precise data than an estimate. We proposed an amendment to do what was provided for in the 2021 census and to put it into law so that future governments would be required to paint the most representative picture of reality possible, which has an impact on investments.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773369" data-originallang="fr">Why did my colleague vote against this?</p>

It is a huge step in the right direction, but it is not enough, obviously. Of course, we must address the decline of French, be it in education or in other fields. We must make the necessary investments and recognize that we need clear and targeted plans to support our communities, especially outside Quebec, where we are seeing a fairly serious decline.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773371" data-originallang="fr">We certainly need to have the right information. Of course, we want Statistics Canada or any other government agency to be able to collect the necessary information to ensure that our children, our schools and our school districts have the data they need to support education in French.</p>

It was very important for us to work with the Government of Quebec in developing Bill <a class="related_link legislation" data-HoCid="11603137" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=11603137&amp;Language=E">C‑13</a>.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773377" data-originallang="fr">We were very happy to learn that an agreement had been signed between the Government of Quebec and the federal government to advance shared priorities. It is obvious that such an agreement is crucial to ensure Quebec's self-determination in many key areas, and that the federal government must be a part of the solution to protect the French language and stand up for official language minority communities.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773378" data-originallang="fr">From the beginning of the debate on Bill C‑13, I have been very clear in saying that French is in decline. We see it here, in western Canada, and we know that it is obviously the case in Quebec. The federal government must keep this in mind not only in the context of this bill, but also, more specifically, when it invests and plans for the future.</p>

The NDP is not in a coalition with anyone. I know that is the message Conservatives like to use to raise funds, but it is not true.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773383" data-originallang="fr">I believe that the FCFA's statement is clear about the fact that they are very pleased with the final bill. The federation certainly fought hard, and we all collaborated to advance their priorities. I am proud that we were able to improve the bill by giving more powers to the Treasury Board. As I said, this bill is a big step forward.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773384" data-originallang="fr">Clearly, we will have to continue our work to meet the objectives of the bill and invest in what our communities need to protect French and official language minority communities. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773385" data-originallang="fr">Finally, I would add that I appreciate that my colleague is raising this priority with respect to the bill, but I have many concerns about the Conservative leader, who talks a lot about cutting funding to Radio-Canada, an organization that is vital to the protection of French, especially in western Canada.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773386" data-originallang="fr">I have concerns about the Conservative leadership, and I question why they do not want to protect French in minority situations in various ways.</p>

	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7773451" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a> is one of the most powerful people in the country, and that is a function of the Prime Minister's Office, which includes a number of serious powers.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773452" data-originallang="en"> Foremost among those is the power to decide, at any time, that Parliament is done, that the work of Parliament is finished and that we are going to have an election. It is the power to decide that Parliament's work can be put on pause, and the important work that is happening at committee could be, not just put on pause, but stopped. It would have to start up again in another session of Parliament.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773453" data-originallang="en">We have seen this power used appropriately over the course of Canadian history, and we have also seen it be abused. One of the most recent examples of the abuse of this power was in the summer of 2020, when the government was embroiled in the WE charity scandal, with many committees studying what had happened. They were calling for witnesses for, and papers and evidence about, what was going on in the government and how the scandal arose. The <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a> decided to say that Parliament was prorogued. All that work stopped. Members of Parliament were not able to come to this place or to work together to do the work that we are elected to do, which is to hold the government to account.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773454" data-originallang="en">We saw that happen in the summer of 2020. It was a controversial decision to prorogue. I think many Canadians were rightly upset about that. I was part of an effort at the procedure and House affairs committee to get to the bottom of why it was the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a> chose to prorogue. One of the real frustrations in that sitting was that the Prime Minister himself refused to come to that study. In fact, we watched Liberal members on that committee filibuster for months on end to avoid a simple invitation to the Prime Minister to come to explain his own actions.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773455" data-originallang="en"> That was certainly an example where we saw the power of prorogation abused. I would say, arguably, just the next year, in 2021, we saw the same <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a> abuse a similar power, which was to dissolve Parliament and declare our work finished, and then we went to the polls. We have fixed election date laws in Canada. Unfortunately, there is no way to punish prime ministers for ignoring those laws, as the Prime Minister did in the fall of 2021 when he called an election while we were still in the midst of a pandemic. In fact, the procedure and House affairs committee was in the process of looking at a government bill designed to make accommodations for the pandemic at election time.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773456" data-originallang="en"> Instead of respecting the work of that committee and the many voices across the country who were saying that Canada was not ready to have an election during a pandemic, the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a> pulled the plug and held the election anyway. It was an election that no one but him wanted, and that was very clear. It was made very clear to all of us on the doorsteps over the course of that election. Nevertheless, it was the Prime Minister, through the power of his office, who was able to do that, without any meaningful accountability.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773457" data-originallang="en">I want to go back to an example from much earlier, but folks would be relieved to hear it is in this century. I am not going all the way back to the 19th century. In 2008, former prime minister Harper effected the most egregious abuse of the power of prorogation when he knew that opposition parties were going to bring a non-confidence motion forward to say that the members of this place did not believe that he should govern. Instead of facing the House and facing that vote, which would have been the honourable thing to do, he chose to abuse the powers of the Prime Minister's Office and prorogued parliament, so opposition members could not bring a motion of non-confidence to the House.</p>

<div class="statement" data-h1="Private Members' Business" data-h2="Amendments to the Standing Orders" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278634" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. Daniel Blaikie" data-timestamp="2023-05-12 13:15:00" id="p7773459"><p data-HoCid="7773459" data-originallang="en"> It was indeed a shameful thing.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773460" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, up until now, there has been a lot of discussion about this, but I do not think there have been real proposals to try to do something about it. It is difficult to do something about it because, in our Constitution, dissolving or proroguing Parliament is said to be a power of the monarch, of the Queen, or now the King. Really, it is a power of the Prime Minister because it is only on the Prime Minister's advice that this is done. Because this is a power that is granted to the monarchy, we need a constitutional amendment to do anything about it, or so we have been told.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773461" data-originallang="en">Let us consider all the important institutions that make up the very foundation of Canadian government. We could think about the monarch, the executive or the government, and we could think about the House of Commons, the judiciary and the Senate.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773462" data-originallang="en">Actually, only one of those is directly elected by Canadians, and that is the House of Commons. The monarch certainly is not elected; we have all been bearing witness to that process recently. The Senate is not elected. Judges are not elected, and I do not think that is a bad thing; we need accountability in the process of their appointment, so they are not elected. The executive is not directly elected; it is actually the House of Commons that ultimately decides who sits in the Prime Minister's chair, or not, based on what happens at election time.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773463" data-originallang="en"> I think that the House of Commons, both as the democratically elected component of the Canadian government and as the institution with the job of holding the government to account, should be the one to decide whether the work here is paused in a prorogation. The House of Commons, as the democratically elected chamber, should be the one to decide if we are done before fixed election date laws say we would be done and to have an early election. No simple motion in the House of Commons can change the Constitution, which is as it should be. Therefore, within the constitutional context that we are in, this motion would allow us, the members of this place, to assert our rightful role in having a much bigger say on when our work begins, when it ends and whether it is stopped or paused by a prime minister. That is a decision that should be in the hands of Canadians.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773464" data-originallang="en">If we want to talk about gatekeeping in Canada, one of the biggest gatekeeping powers that exists is the power of the Prime Minister to get out of accountability to Parliament. Anyone who is concerned about fighting inappropriate gatekeeping in Canada should be concerned to constrain that power by the Prime Minister.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773465" data-originallang="en"> That is what this motion is really about. It is about making it more difficult for prime ministers to prorogue Parliament to get out of facing accountability on a confidence vote. It is about making it more difficult for prime ministers to get out of accountability for scandals like the WE Charity scandal or the question of Afghan detainees by telling members of this Parliament to go back to their ridings and not come back until the Prime Minister decides he is okay with having them back. It is about ensuring that the Prime Minister does not get to inappropriately influence votes in this place by suddenly declaring something that has nothing to do with confidence and everything to do with covering his own behind or a special pet project in order to try to force members to vote for something that they would not otherwise vote for. That is what this motion is about, and that is why it is so important that this motion pass. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773466" data-originallang="en">It is about time that the House of Commons started pushing back on those other unelected parts of the Canadian governance structure and assert its own authority and its own decision-making power, especially in regard to our ability to sit in this place and to hold governments to account.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773467" data-originallang="en">How would it constrain the power of the Prime Minister? As I said, there is no perfect solution without a constitutional amendment. However, it would mean that a prime minister who wanted to prorogue would have the option of first having a confidence vote in the House of Commons before a prorogation. If the Prime Minister did not do that, it would guarantee that the first order of business when parliamentarians came back would not be the Prime Minister's Speech from the Throne, where they get to frame the issues however they like; it would be a debate and a vote of confidence in the government after it made a decision to prorogue.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773468" data-originallang="en"> I say that would have been especially important in the case of the Harper prorogation, because he prorogued in order to avoid a confidence vote. We know that the next way for opposition parties at that time to have a confidence vote would have been on an opposition day motion. Who decides when to have opposition day motions? The government decides when to have an opposition day motion. Therefore, that does not really work as an accountability mechanism. If the Prime Minister can prorogue for as long as they want and then delay an opposition day motion for just about as long as they like after we come back, then opposition parties do not have the ability to hold the government to account in the appropriate way.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773469" data-originallang="en"> What this motion would guarantee is that there would be a moment of accountability at the beginning of every Parliament, with a confidence vote. There would be a possibility of a prime minister doing the right thing and testing the confidence of the chamber before prorogation; if they do not, it would guarantee that the first order of business when we came back would be a confidence vote to have that accountability for the House of Commons. It makes it clear for members how they can go about initiating a confidence vote. It lays out a process for that. I will spare folks the details; they are in the motion. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773470" data-originallang="en">Another thing it does, which is also quite important, is that it specifically says what votes would be votes of confidence. Traditionally, by convention, the Speech from the Throne is a vote of confidence. This motion would simply add that into the Standing Orders so that it would no longer be a question for which we have to call in a whole bunch of constitutional experts who have studied the history of Canada since 1867 to weigh in on it. We would know because it would be written in the Standing Orders that it is a vote of confidence. We would know that the budget vote is a vote of confidence because it would be written down in the Standing Orders. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773471" data-originallang="en">We would know that the main vote on estimates is a confidence motion. That matters because there have been many times where we have voted all night on the estimates, on every line item, and it is always a debate. We see the media questioning if the government could fall on any vote. Some people say it could. Others say that it cannot; it is complicated; maybe it would; maybe it would not; maybe it would lose that vote and the next day it would have to come to the House for a more explicitly worded motion of confidence; or maybe the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a> would decide.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773472" data-originallang="en">We are a 21st-century democracy. How is it so unclear whether the only elected chamber, the only elected part of our Constitution, would sit or not sit, have confidence or not have confidence, have an election or not have an election? These are things we should be able to put our heads together on to sort out so it is crystal clear to Canadians, who should not have to get a Ph.D. in Canadian constitutional history to understand what the heck is going on in this place. It is something we should be able to teach in a grade 12 civics class and be proud of. The idea behind this motion is to make it a heck of a lot more clear so that we can do exactly that. To have a lack of clarity around these issues that are so central to the proper functioning of our democracy is to invite the kind of toxic debates and intractable disputes that we see too often now in western democracies about whether this was a power grab or if the government acted appropriately or not. The way to defend this is to seek the maximum amount of clarity before we are in a crisis. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773473" data-originallang="en">Already this year, there has been speculation in the media about whether a motion in the House would be a confidence or non-confidence vote. The government House leader refused to comment, so it hung in the air. It should not be that way. We should know clearly whether something is or is not a vote of confidence.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773474" data-originallang="en"> There have been rumours around prorogation already in this Parliament. We should know that, if a prime minister is going to prorogue and we think it is a bad decision, the House of Commons itself will have the opportunity to pronounce on whether the government is making an acceptable decision or not. That is something the House ought to be able to do because we are the only ones who are elected with a mandate to make those kinds of decisions. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773475" data-originallang="en">It is not the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a> or anybody else. It is certainly not a King or Queen who has the ability to make that decision. It is not a decision for the Senate, where senators who have all been appointed by previous prime ministers to make that decision. This is the place that decision ought to be made. That is how we put democracy before gatekeeping. That is what this motion is about. That is why I encourage all members of the House to give their support to this motion. </p>

	<p data-HoCid="7773477" data-originallang="en">He is a thoughtful guy, and I am sure he has thought about the other side.

One hopes that it has enough clarity and instruction behind it that folks would find it hard to abuse.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773479" data-originallang="en">One of the ways I was concerned this new way of presenting a confidence motion might be abused is as a dilatory tactic, so one of the provisions in this motion is that, to move a motion of non-confidence or confidence, as the case may be, there are two ways to present those motions. One would need a mover and 20 other members from at least two recognized political parties to sign onto it. That is one way I have sought to ensure this new type of motion would not be used continuously as a dilatory tactic. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773480" data-originallang="en">I can say more about that. If members read the motion in its entirety, they will find that there are some other guardrails in there as well because of that. In fact, what the Speaker read in the guiding principles is exactly that, that this should not be seen as a dilatory tactic or some other way to conduct funny business. What we want is for members of Parliament to have lots of notice when votes of confidence are coming, a full day of debate and a vote at the end of that day so that it is a clear process that is hopefully not open to abuse.</p>

It has been studied in the House and outside the House. The reasons why I chose not to refer it to the procedure and House affairs committee are twofold.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773484" data-originallang="en">The first is out of respect for the work that it is doing currently on foreign interference and a number of important issues, and an issue of privilege, actually, after the last day, with respect to the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278408" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278408&amp;Language=E">Wellington—Halton Hills</a>.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773485" data-originallang="en">The other reason is that I think it is high time we just got this done. I do think there is enough time to examine the content of the motion. I think that this would be a significant improvement on the current state of affairs.</p>

When the House votes on motions or bills, we see that the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a> does not always respect the will of the House when what has been proposed does not come from him.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773491" data-originallang="fr">For example, my colleague moved a motion on tax havens. Even though it had support in the House, the government did not introduce the measures that the motion called on the government to introduce. Another colleague had a bill passed to provide 50 weeks of EI sickness benefits to people with cancer. The government never followed through, even though it was the will of the House. A bill by one of our Conservative colleagues was passed about the family transfer of businesses. The government would not implement it.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773492" data-originallang="fr">What does my esteemed colleague think of that?</p>

That is why I think that we as members of Parliament must take measures to ask for that respect. This is about targeting the Prime Minister's important powers and saying the elected chamber should have more say in these decisions. We can get the federal government to take us much more seriously.</p>

<div class="statement" data-h1="Private Members' Business" data-h2="Amendments to the Standing Orders" data-intervention-type="Question" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278409" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. Chandra Arya (Nepean, Lib.)" data-timestamp="2023-05-12 13:35:00" id="12212444"><p data-HoCid="7773494" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I am rising to speak to Motion No. 79, sponsored by the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278634" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278634&amp;Language=E">Elmwood—Transcona</a>, which proposes a permanent change to the Standing Orders respecting confidence motions.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773495" data-originallang="en">Before I speak to the content of the proposal contained in Motion No. 79, I would like to discuss some important principles that should guide our work when contemplating changes to the Standing Orders, especially when the changes would be permanent changes to the rules of the House. There is a long-standing tradition of the House in considering changes to our Standing Orders. This tradition includes two important principles. The first is that any change or suite of changes should benefit from a thorough study by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. The second is that any change to the rules that govern our deliberations should be done on a consensual basis.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773496" data-originallang="en">The importance of having changes to the Standing Orders considered by the procedure and House affairs committee seems to be self-evident to most members of the House. These are our rules; they guide all the work we conduct in this place, and any change must be well understood by all members of the House. As a result, the procedure and House affairs committee plays an important role in studying the Standing Orders as they are, as well as proposed changes before they can be considered by the whole House.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773497" data-originallang="en">In fact, Standing Order 51, chapter VII, which deals with the special debates that the House make take up and is the subject of the proposed amendment contained in Motion No. 79, provides a mechanism that requires the House to study the Standing Orders at the beginning of each Parliament. Standing Order 51 provides that the government, through a minister, must designate an order of the day for the consideration of a motion to take note of the Standing Orders and procedures of the House, which has precedence over all other business. The debate on the designated day is then permanently referred to the procedure and House affairs committee for study. Having these debates permanently referred to the procedure and House affairs committee allows the committee to take up studies over the course of the Parliament to review and consider changes to the Standing Orders.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773498" data-originallang="en">The purpose of Standing Order 51 is to allow members to bring forward ideas on changes to the Standing Orders, which can then be studied by the procedure and House affairs committee. During the committee's study of the Standing Orders, the committee can hear from expert witnesses, including the Clerk of the House and other senior procedural clerks, to bring to the attention of the members possible adverse consequences that may result from certain changes. This expert testimony ensures the members of the committee consider changes to our rules by using an evidence-based process. Witnesses may also suggest changes to the proposed standing order changes to ensure consistency and alignment with the Standing Orders and practices of the House. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773499" data-originallang="en">I believe that the procedure and House affairs committee plays an essential role in reviewing the Standing Orders, and I know the members on that committee take this work very seriously and with a great deal of pride. We must always keep in mind that changes to our Standing Orders affect every member of the House, and we not only need to get it right, but we also need to know and appreciate the long-term consequences of such changes. When we make changes in a majority context, we need to appreciate and understand how these changes will operate in the minority context, and the inverse is just as important.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773500" data-originallang="en">I would now like to turn my attention, and that of the members, to Motion No. 79. The member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278634" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278634&amp;Language=E">Elmwood—Transcona</a> has selected, as his item of Private Members' Business, Motion No. 79, on confidence motions. The motion would create a new scheme in the “Special Debates” chapter in the Standing Orders dealing with confidence motions.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773501" data-originallang="en"> The preamble of Motion No. 79 states, in part (a), that “(i) it is a prerogative of the Crown to prorogue or dissolve Parliament at its pleasure“, and that “(iv) the confidence convention has never been clearly codified and this has sometimes led to confusion among members and the general public as to the nature and significance of certain votes”.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773502" data-originallang="en">I would like to spend part of my remarks on the Crown's prerogatives. Page 43 of <em>House of Commons Procedure and Practice </em>states:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7773503" data-originallang="en"> An essential feature of parliamentary government is that the Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to, or must answer to, the House of Commons for their actions and must enjoy the support and the confidence of a majority of the Members of that Chamber to remain in office. This is commonly referred to as the confidence convention. This complex constitutional subject, a matter of tradition that is not written into any statute or Standing Order of the House.... </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7773504" data-originallang="en">Members can see that royal prerogatives are not found in any statute or in the Standing Orders. There is, however, one reference to confidence in the Standing Orders, that is, in Standing Order 6, in relation to the election of the Speaker. Precedents are clear that this provision is unnecessary and outdated, since the House itself elects the Speaker of the House, and the executive no longer plays any formal role in the election of the Speaker.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773505" data-originallang="en"> <em>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</em>, at page 43, goes on to articulate the point that confidence is not a matter of parliamentary procedure. It says, “What constitutes a question of confidence in the government varies with the circumstances. Confidence is not a matter of parliamentary procedure, nor is it something on which the Speaker can be asked to rule.”</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773506" data-originallang="en">There was a time when there were references in the Standing Orders to motions of non-confidence in relation to the consideration of supply. Page 44 of <em>House of Commons Procedure and Practice </em> sets out how the Standing Orders were modified in this regard and when these changes were removed:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7773507" data-originallang="en"> When the Standing Orders respecting supply were amended in 1968, it was specified that, in each of the three supply periods, the opposition could designate not more than two of the motions proposed on allotted days as motions of non-confidence in the government. This was the first time the notion of confidence found expression in the Standing Orders. This rule was modified provisionally in March 1975 to remove the non-confidence qualification; the motions would still be brought to a vote but the vote would not automatically be considered an expression of confidence in the government. The provisional Standing Orders lapsed at the beginning of the following session and the term found its way back into the 1977 version of the Standing Orders. No further changes were made until June 1985, when the Standing Orders were again modified to remove the non-confidence provision with regard to supply. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7773508" data-originallang="en">For 43 years, there have been no operative Standing Orders that deal with confidence. There is a good reason for this. Since many Crown prerogatives have been superseded by statutes, there are still royal prerogatives that are not found in statutes, including but not limited to foreign affairs and treaty making, and the powers to prorogue or dissolve Parliament.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773509" data-originallang="en">Now that I have addressed the notion of the Crown's prerogatives in relation to the prerogatives to prorogue or dissolve Parliament, I would like to speak of the mechanics of how Motion No. 79, if adopted, would operate.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773510" data-originallang="en">I have not made up my mind about whether I will support this motion or oppose it. I will say, however, that I think this motion would benefit from study at the procedure and House affairs committee. The committee could really dig into the interplay between the role of the Standing Orders and the Crown prerogatives, and whether the scheme that is proposed in Motion No. 79 is acceptable in the context of our rules, given the informal nature of non-confidence motions in the Standing Orders.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773511" data-originallang="en">Finally, I do not think that two one-hour debates are sufficient to fully understand the implications this motion would have on the procedures and practices of this House. That said, I will continue to have an open mind about the proposal because I have great respect for my colleague from <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278634" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278634&amp;Language=E">Elmwood—Transcona</a> and the views of other members who will speak in debate on this motion.</p>
	</div>
<div class="statement" data-h1="Private Members' Business" data-h2="Amendments to the Standing Orders" data-intervention-type="Question" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278420" data-person-speaking-attribution="Mr. Michael Cooper (St. Albert—Edmonton, CPC)" data-timestamp="2023-05-12 13:45:00" id="12212505"><p data-HoCid="7773512" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on Motion No. 79, introduced by the hon. member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278634" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278634&amp;Language=E">Elmwood—Transcona</a>. The motion would make substantial changes to the Standing Orders pertaining to confidence votes and the prorogation of Parliament. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773513" data-originallang="en">With respect to confidence votes, it would make significant changes in a number of different ways. Perhaps less of a change is that it would seek to amend the Standing Orders to expressly provide that votes on the main estimates, the budget and the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne be treated as questions of confidence. By convention, for all intents and purposes, these votes are treated as questions of confidence. It would, indeed, be difficult to imagine a scenario in which a government could survive losing any such vote.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773514" data-originallang="en">Even more, however, this motion would significantly regulate and limit the ability of members to bring forward and put on notice motions of non-confidence in the government. It would do so in three ways. First, in order to put such a motion on notice, the signatures of at least 20 members of Parliament from more than one of the recognized parties would be required. Second, only one such motion of non-confidence could be put on notice per supply period. Third, members would be limited to either sponsoring or signing such a motion once per session.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773515" data-originallang="en">With respect to prorogation, this motion would require that the government put on notice a confidence motion upon the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a> expressing the intention to advise and consult the Governor General with respect to prorogation. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773516" data-originallang="en">The hon. member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278634" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278634&amp;Language=E">Elmwood—Transcona</a> is a learned member. He brings a great deal of institutional knowledge and a good understanding of matters of procedure, and I have a lot of respect for him. I appreciate, in that regard, the spirit in which the member is seeking to make changes to the Standing Orders. However, I will be unable to support this motion, primarily because of the process that the member has proposed in making changes to the Standing Orders. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773517" data-originallang="en">Two hours of debate, nothing more, nothing less, is the process that the member has chosen. There would be no study or consultation. Why is this? It is because that is the process for private members' motions, and it is the way in which the hon. member has embarked upon amending the Standing Orders. I would submit that, with regard to the substantial changes that are being proposed, two hours of debate would be completely inadequate under the circumstances.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773518" data-originallang="en">I would submit further that it is all the more inadequate given the fact that many aspects of this motion are seemingly novel, as the hon. member conceded when I put a question to him earlier. Although much ink has been spilled on, for example, the subject of prorogation, and although the procedure and House affairs committee has undertaken multiple studies in recent years on prorogation, what the hon. member is specifically proposing has not been studied. This is that the government should put forward a confidence motion upon the Prime Minister expressing the intention to prorogue Parliament. Similarly, the significant way in which the hon. member is proposing to limit the ability to put on notice other motions of non-confidence in the government has not been considered either.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773519" data-originallang="en">The hon. member is quite right to say that he is not ashamed that some of these ideas are novel ones. It is good to come up with new ideas. All hon. members should make an effort to bring fresh ideas, but new ideas need to be tested.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773520" data-originallang="en">What would have been better is if this motion had contained a clause referring the items and the changes proposed to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. That would have provided an opportunity to hear from witnesses, including experts, to better understand the implications of the many changes that the member is proposing. Had the hon. member included such a clause in the motion, I would have been very open to supporting the motion. It is unfortunate that the motion does not contain such a clause. On that basis alone, I am unable to support the motion. </p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773521" data-originallang="en">The need for study is further underscored by the fact that the motion could have constitutional implications as it pertains to prorogation. The Governor General derives the authority to prorogue Parliament pursuant to section 38 of the Constitution Act of 1867. More specifically, section 38 provides the Governor General with the authority to summon Parliament and therefore, by extension, to prorogue it. The authority of the Governor General is exercisable according to unwritten constitutional convention upon the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a> providing advice and consulting with the Governor General. It is the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister alone who consults the Governor General on the question of prorogation.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773522" data-originallang="en">By prescribing that a motion of confidence be put before the <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="214296" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=214296&amp;Language=E">Prime Minister</a> goes to the Governor General limits the discretion of the Prime Minister to seek prorogation. Moreover, the motion proposes to insert a wedge between the Prime Minister and the Governor General and that, in turn, could impact upon the manner in which the Governor General responds to the advice of the Prime Minister. I would note that, on the question of constitutional implications, section 41(a) of the Constitution Act of 1982 provides that any change respecting the Office of the Governor General requires a constitutional amendment.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773523" data-originallang="en"> All of this is to say that there are a number of considerations that need to be studied and considered, and on that basis, it would be premature to adopt the motion at this time.</p>

<div class="statement" data-h1="Private Members' Business" data-h2="Amendments to the Standing Orders" data-intervention-type="Debate" data-person-speaking-HoCid="278372" data-person-speaking-attribution="Ms. Christine Normandin (Saint-Jean, BQ)" data-timestamp="2023-05-12 13:55:00" id="12212533"><p data-HoCid="7773524" data-originallang="fr">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Motion No. 79, moved by my colleague from <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278634" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278634&amp;Language=E">Elmwood—Transcona</a>, whom I thank, by the way, for his excellent speech.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773525" data-originallang="fr">Despite the fact that I still consider myself a young politician, perhaps less so in age than in years of experience, I feel that I have learned a lot about procedural matters during my three and a half years in office. I had the pleasure of participating in the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, particularly when it came time to set up a hybrid Parliament during the pandemic. Although I stopped sitting regularly on the committee after that, I followed its work from a distance. Among that work was the study on proroguing Parliament during the summer of 2020. This was the first time that the government was required to justify its use of prorogation after the fact. As I will explain, this did not solve the problem of partisan use of prorogation.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773526" data-originallang="fr">Today's motion just happens to touch on the framework of prorogation, along with the definition of a vote of confidence. I want to quickly review these two aspects of the motion, which are in some ways intertwined.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773527" data-originallang="fr">With respect to prorogation, the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs had the opportunity to read and analyze the “Report on the Government's Report to Parliament: August 2020 Prorogation—COVID-19 Pandemic” and produce its own report on that report. That report noted the various times in history when the government has used prorogation for what could be described as partisan purposes. I would like to take a moment to read part of that report. It is rather enlightening.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="8020229" data-originallang="fr">The first example is from 1873:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7773528" data-originallang="fr"> Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald requested and received a prorogation from Governor General Lord Dufferin when facing a loss of support in the House of Commons during a political scandal that would be dubbed the Pacific scandal. The Committee heard that the 1873 prorogation ended a committee inquiry into the matter but that the controversy over the scandal resumed during the subsequent parliamentary session. Sir John resigned a few weeks after Parliament resumed. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8020230" data-originallang="fr">The next example is more recent. It is from 2002:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7773529" data-originallang="fr"> Prime Minister Jean Chrétien requested and received a prorogation from Governor General Adrienne Clarkson at a time when details were emerging of a political scandal that would be dubbed the sponsorship scandal. The prorogation prevented a report from the House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Accounts on the sponsorship scandal from being presented in the House. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8020231" data-originallang="fr">The next example is from one year later, in 2003:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7773530" data-originallang="fr"> Mr. Chrétien prorogued Parliament until February 2004. This delayed the tabling of the Auditor General’s report on the sponsorship scandal, which was due to be tabled that November, until after Mr. Chrétien left office. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8020232" data-originallang="fr">Here is an example from 2008:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7773531" data-originallang="fr"> Prime Minister Stephen Harper requested and received a prorogation from Governor General Michaëlle Jean in December 2008. The prorogation occurred at a time when a global financial crisis had recently begun. However, the prorogation also enabled the government to postpone a non-confidence vote in the House that was being sought by the Liberal Party, the New Democratic Party, who had proposed a coalition, and the Bloc Québécois, who had agreed to support the coalition under a supply and confidence agreement. It was noted that the Governor General granted the request for prorogation but only after several hours of reflection. By the time the House resumed sitting in January 2009, the opposition coalition had collapsed. One witness referred to these circumstances as being driven by a breakdown in good governance within the Liberal caucus. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="8020233" data-originallang="fr">The last example is from 2010:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7773532" data-originallang="fr"> Prime Minister Harper requested and received a prorogation from Governor General Michaëlle Jean, from January 2010 to March 2010. The reason for the three-month duration of the prorogation was to allow Parliament to recess for the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. However, the prorogation also postponed the examination by the House of Commons Special Committee on the Canadian Mission in Afghanistan into alleged mistreatment of Afghan detainees while in custody. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7773533" data-originallang="fr">The 2020 prorogation was no exception to the list of prorogations that were requested for partisan purposes. Although the government invoked the pandemic as a reason, in the eyes of several witnesses who appeared before the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, there was some doubt about that justification. The fact that the government was mired in the WE scandal, that the prorogation lasted for a long time, five weeks, and that the government's report was biased, led the committee to conclude that reforms around the prorogation of the House and votes of confidence needed to be clarified.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773534" data-originallang="fr">Essentially, while the legislative change in 2017 was intended to make the use of prorogation more transparent after the fact, the goal was not met. In a way, the purpose of Motion No. 79 is to make the use of prorogation transparent upstream instead of downstream, after the fact, when it is too late. Essentially, Motion No. 79 would allow, prior to a prorogation of the House and after the Prime Minister expresses an intention to recommend such a prorogation, a motion of confidence to be moved, in which case the motion should meet a range of criteria.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773535" data-originallang="fr">It will have to be tabled with four days' notice and to be signed by 20 members of the House representing more than one recognized party, which removes some of the partisanship from the initiative.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773536" data-originallang="fr">To avoid abuse, there are safeguards in place. Only one such motion can be placed on notice per supply period and only one can be sponsored or signed by the same member of the House in a session of a Parliament. The text of the motion can either be, “That the House has lost confidence in the government” or “That the House has confidence in the government”. Both are quite clear and unambiguous. It cannot be amended. The time of the debate is limited to a maximum of one ordinary sitting day and a maximum of 20 minutes per member and 10 minutes for questions and answers. Consequently, no stalling tactics are possible. Once the four days have passed after notice was given, the motion takes precedence over all other business of the House. It is debated and then voted on.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773537" data-originallang="fr">Linking prorogation to a confidence vote will hopefully make a government that wants to use it not only think twice about the risk of being defeated and triggering a general election, but also consider whether it has the grounds to seek prorogation with the assent of other parties in the House.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773538" data-originallang="fr">We must remember that the prorogation of a session puts an end to all the business of Parliament, with some exceptions. Every committee, with the exception of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, stops its work when prorogation occurs.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773539" data-originallang="fr">Every time there is a partisan prorogation, it is the taxpayers, the citizens, who pay the price, since many bills that affect their daily life die on the Order Paper.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773540" data-originallang="fr">In a political context where we can expect more and more governments to be elected with a minority, making prorogation increasingly likely, Motion No. 79 provides a framework that is entirely justified and welcome.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773541" data-originallang="fr">As for the confidence vote aspect, how does a confidence vote work? How do we define what constitutes a confidence vote?</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773542" data-originallang="fr">Actually, it is not always particularly clear. I would refer members to what the parliamentary website tells us. Currently, matters of confidence are regulated by constitutional convention. The website states:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7773543" data-originallang="fr"> As the confidence convention is an unwritten parliamentary practice, it is not always clear what constitutes a question of confidence. Motions that clearly state that the House of Commons has lost confidence in the government, motions concerning the government’s budgetary policy, motions for the granting of supply, motions in relation to the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne, and motions the government clearly identifies as questions of confidence are usually recognized as such. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7773544" data-originallang="fr">This convention is subject to interpretation, so some uncertainty needs to be cleared up in terms of the definition of “vote of confidence”. That is what Motion No. 79 seeks to do.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773545" data-originallang="fr">Professor Hugo Cyr had this to say to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs:</p>
	<blockquote><p data-HoCid="7773546" data-originallang="fr"> It is essential to understand that it is up to the House of Commons itself to determine whether it gives and maintains its confidence in the government. There is sometimes confusion in this respect, as prime ministers sometimes state that a vote on a particular bill or issue will be a confidence vote. </p>
	</blockquote><p data-HoCid="7773547" data-originallang="fr">This undue pressure on parliamentarians could be considered a form of blackmail, and that has no place in a democracy. The government should never be able to hold an opposition responsible for defeating a government, for example, on an issue that should never have been a matter of confidence.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773548" data-originallang="fr">For all these reasons, both with respect to prorogation and the framework for votes of confidence, I commend the work of the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278634" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278634&amp;Language=E">Elmwood—Transcona</a> on Motion No. 79. It lines up with the recommendations the Bloc Québécois made during the drafting of the report on the prorogation of the summer of 2020.</p>

When we are allotted our private member's business, it is done by lottery. I say this to make sure viewers understand. He was fortunate enough to be up near the top, and he has generously donated his time and his space to give parliamentarians this important opportunity. I really see this as important because I think this is an opportunity for colleagues from all parties in the House to start really, truly thinking about what it means to be a member of the House.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773551" data-originallang="en">We are members of Parliament, first and foremost, no matter what position we hold. We got to this place legitimately because we captured the attention and the confidence of our constituents in our respective ridings. Every person in this House has earned their spot because of the democratic mandate given to them by the people of their constituency.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773552" data-originallang="en">That comes before all else, whether one holds a position as Leader of the Opposition or a parliamentary secretary or one is promoted to become a minister of cabinet. First and foremost, one is a member of the House. I see today's debate on Motion No. 79 as an opportunity to reassert ourselves as members of the House and to more clearly understand the rules by which we operate.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773553" data-originallang="en">Today's motion, of course, is centring on the confidence convention. For constituents of Cowichan—Malahat—Langford who may be watching today's debate, when we start talking about procedure and the Standing Orders, I know it starts to sound like inside baseball. However, there is a reason these debates are important. The Standing Orders and how they are interpreted, how they are written and how they operate allow an elected member of Parliament to do their job properly.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773554" data-originallang="en">The government has all kinds of resources at its disposal, but for members of the opposition in particular, the rules of the House put us on an equal footing with the government. The rules are particularly important to members of the opposition because of that very fact.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773555" data-originallang="en">When it comes to the confidence convention, we know that, generally speaking, confidence votes come in a few different forms, but they have never really been clearly spelled out. We are attempting to spell them out today. We know that, for example, anything involving the spending of funds, whether it is a budget implementation act or appropriation bills, would be a motion of confidence. Also by convention, anything else that the government states is a matter of confidence can be interpreted in the same way.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773556" data-originallang="en">This entire conversation is also rooted in the conversation that we need to have about responsible government. This is because, of course, in our Westminster system, responsible government means that the executive branch owes its responsibility to Parliament and not to the monarch.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773557" data-originallang="en">We have to understand that we went through centuries of turmoil and fighting to arrive at this democratic ideal. If we look at the history of England, especially during the 1600s, the civil wars, the establishment of the Commonwealth, the Restoration and the Glorious Revolution were all taking place. It was a tumultuous time. Here in our own country of Canada, as well, we have had rebellions. We had the Durham report, which resulted in a pathway towards responsible government. These are important concepts that we have to understand.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773558" data-originallang="en">In the Standing Orders, there have been references to the confidence convention in the past. It was mentioned back in the 1960s, but through the 1970s and, again, in the 1980s, the provisions were modified several times so that those provisions were actually removed.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773559" data-originallang="en">Let us turn now to Motion No. 79. Boiling it down, it would essentially require that we hold a confidence vote to take place at the start of every new Parliament or following an expression of intent by the Prime Minister before that person prorogues. There are two very important things here. It would essentially establish, for members of Parliament, for the benefit of members of the House and for the general public, a standardized, streamlined format.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773560" data-originallang="en">One of the things that we look at when we look at Motion No. 79 is, for example, the requirement that, if a member of the House were to bring forward a motion of confidence or non-confidence, it would have to be signed by 20 of his or her peers, and they would have to be representatives of more than one party. This makes sense because, if a confidence or non-confidence vote is going to succeed, it is obviously going to take more than one party. This would take away from anything frivolous happening. The motion would place this in the existing Standing Orders right after section 53(1), the chapter that outlines how special debates are to happen.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773561" data-originallang="en"> I have heard members of Parliament from the Liberals and the Conservatives, in preceding speeches, wondering about how this would impact the prerogative of the Crown. They need only look at the preamble of the motion, which states right away that it is a prerogative of the Crown to prorogue and dissolve Parliament at its pleasure. We cannot take away from that fact. However, what we can do, as members of the House, is amend our own Standing Orders to provide for a road map on how the House can formally voice its opinion on whether the government of the day continues to have the confidence of the House. This is extremely important because prime ministers have abused that power.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773562" data-originallang="en">I look at the previous Conservative speaker's speech on this when he said that he could not support this motion because it deserved further study. It is quite shocking that apparently the Conservatives need to study the issue at the procedure and House affairs committee to figure out if they need to limit the prime minister's power.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="7773565" data-originallang="en">Mr. Speaker, what we are seeing here with the Liberals and the Conservatives, if they do end up voting against this motion, is their own naked self-interest because, for them, the current system works. They are the status quo parties, and we are not going to see a meaningful push for reform against the Standing Orders because they want to have the opportunity for their executive to use that power and to not in any way be constrained.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773566" data-originallang="en">Therefore, I implore all members of the House to remember how I started my speech. First and foremost, members are a member of the House, and this is a real opportunity to stand up not only for their rights in this place but also for the rights of the constituents who sent them here, to codify that and to make sure that we have a clear pathway laid out for how confidence is tested in this place.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773567" data-originallang="en">I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to speak.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="7773568" data-originallang="en"> I want to thank again the member for <a class="related_link politician" data-HoCid="278634" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=278634&amp;Language=E">Elmwood—Transcona</a> for giving us the opportunity to debate this. I very much hope that members will find it in their conscience to support this important amendment to our Standing Orders.</p>
