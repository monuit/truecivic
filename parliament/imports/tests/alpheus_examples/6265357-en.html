I haven't prepared remarks, but I have some remarks.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3450461" data-originallang="en">We all know about false pride, but we seldom hear about false humility. Let me tell you that it is with a sense of real humility that I accept the confidence you gave me today.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3450462" data-originallang="en">I thank you very much, Mr. Stoffer and the rest of the members of this committee.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3450463" data-originallang="en"> I'm fully aware that I sit here at my first meeting of this committee and that there are a lot of other people here who have more merit than I do, both at this committee and in the House. I will take this responsibility very seriously. There isn't a day that goes by when I don't think that even the reason for our sitting here in this House comes more from the merits of the veterans who fought for our democracy, human rights and rule of law than we did.... The democracy that we defend was earned before it was earned by us—it was earned by veterans—and I think of it every day. It's not because I'm sitting here now that I'll stop thinking about it.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3450464" data-originallang="en">Thank you very, very much. I hope to work very well with you in working hard.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3450465" data-originallang="en">I understand that next Tuesday we're going to deal with the regular motions, the routine motions, and that with next Thursday being on a Friday schedule, we will not meet.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3450466" data-originallang="en">That's all I have to say. I thank you again.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3450467" data-originallang="en">Merci beaucoup.</p>

I think the committee may agree that we send a letter to Mr. Blaney, to Ms. Adams, and Mr. Casey thanking them for their service to the veteran community while they were on the committee. We've always done that in the past.</p>

	<p data-HoCid="3450479" data-originallang="en">I certainly would like to echo what Mr. Stoffer said that we send letters to the people who served on our committee. I want to congratulate you on being the Chair.</p>
	<p data-HoCid="3450480" data-originallang="en">If I may, and you can certainly shut me up if you want, but we do have some vets in the room and some with service animals too, and I want us to recognize that they are here with us with their service dogs and that they helped make what this country's all about. I want to thank them for their service to our country and to having this called a democracy that we have all strived for. I want to thank them for coming. There are four vets in the room. There could be some more. I want to certainly point out the vets that have their service dogs with them.</p>
