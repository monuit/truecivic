              <ParaText id="8929914">Mr. Speaker, forestry is a cornerstone of Canada's economy, supporting more than 200,000 good jobs and sustaining hundreds of rural, northern and indigenous communities from coast to coast, yet once again forestry workers are being left behind by the government's failure to secure a fair softwood lumber agreement. In August, the <Affiliation DbId="317577" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised $1.2 billion in support, to respond to Trump's tariffs and duties, which the sector is still waiting for, and just $50 million is earmarked for workers. That is not a serious plan; it is a token gesture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8929915">Almost 50,000 jobs in British Columbia alone are at risk, and entire communities could lose their livelihoods. Forestry families deserve more than press releases and photo-ops; they deserve real and urgent action. The government must stand with Canada's forestry workers, with urgent investments that protect jobs, strengthen communities and build a sustainable future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8929921">After 10 years, families live in a haunted house of debt and a nightmare on main street: monster deficits, prices that jump-scare at the till and vampire taxes draining paycheques. Under the Liberals, too many cupboards are bare, and there are empty bank accounts, empty fridges and empty stomachs. Canadians do not need another pumpkin spice speech or a Frankenbudget stitched together with buzzwords; they need Conservative tax cut treats, not Liberal spending tricks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8929922">Conservatives are calling for something simple: Make life affordable, end the hidden taxes that spook the grocery bill and stop the inflation tax by cutting waste and living within our means. Canadians have had enough of our carnival huckster <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s using scare tactics. On November 4, we had better see a real budget, not s'mores of his candy-coated, stomach-churning fudge-it.</ParaText>

Its global vision through World Impact Ministries has touched over 100 nations, fostering cultural harmony and purpose-driven lives right here in Toronto.</ParaText>

These entrepreneurs are the driving force behind innovation, job creation and local economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8929929">Small business owners are feeling the pressure, though, from rising costs, excessive red tape, unfair taxes, crime and ongoing economic uncertainty. Unfortunately, their struggles have been ignored by the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8929930">In recent years, Conservatives have pushed for overdue carbon rebates and have pushed against tax increases on payroll, capital gains and excise taxes. We are also leading the charge on criminal justice reform so people can operate a business safely. We will keep doing everything we can to help small businesses grow, through red tape reduction and tax cuts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8929931">I encourage everyone this week to support a local small business. Know, on this side of the House, that we recognize the sacrifices entrepreneurs make and the taxes they pay to keep Canada going.</ParaText>

Yesterday, the Auditor General confirmed that, eight years after a damning report by her office, the agency's services to the public have gone further downhill. The situation has not improved. Only 5% of citizens managed to get through to an agent within the 15 minutes specified by the service standards. The Liberals cannot claim ignorance. The Auditor General warned them about this situation back in 2017. They simply failed to resolve it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8930148">Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General report shows that the CRA had a huge increase in deflected calls, from one million to eight million in one year. People in the southwest wait hours, sometimes days, to reach a service agent, and then they have to deal with huge delays in resolving their file, even if the CRA made the mistake. The CRA fails to meet its own service standards after already lowering them, and the odds are high that the agents will give inaccurate information, but its budget went up 70%.</ParaText>

Those who signed the petition from across the country have done so in hopes that the Government of Canada will take action to stem the tide of homelessness among the over four million homeless cats across the country and help support them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930190"> They are calling upon the Government of Canada to put in place free sterilization nationwide, and the reason behind this is very simple. They say that sterilization would prevent unwanted litters and thus reduce the number of abandoned cats, would have positive effects on cats' behaviour, would reduce fights and the risk of communicable diseases, and, of course, would decrease the chance of cats being abandoned.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8930192">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present a petition from concerned citizens in my riding and across Canada regarding a proposal by the Liberal-led finance committee to remove the advancement of religion as a charitable purpose under the Income Tax Act. More than 30,000 registered charities, approximately 42% of all charities in Canada, fall under the category of advancing religion. These faith-based organizations operate food banks, refugee programs, long-term care homes, schools, hospitals, shelters and much more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930193">Canadians are deeply concerned that removing charitable status from these organizations would undermine not only freedom of religion and expression, but also the ability of these groups to continue their work serving those in need regardless of their backgrounds or beliefs. Therefore, the government must reject this harmful recommendation and protect the charitable status of religious organizations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8930213">The impact that these proposed closures would have on small communities across the B.C. coast would be catastrophic. Port Renfrew, in my riding on south Vancouver Island, alone would lose $11 million to $12 million per year, effectively ending Port Renfrew. According to DFO's own statistics, B.C. could lose over 9,000 jobs, 300,000 salmon anglers and over $400 million in household income per year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930214">DFO is proposing both commercial and recreational fishing closures with the stated goal of protecting the southern resident killer whales, with the decision next month. This proposal targets the recreational fishing industry and ignores numerous other factors that contribute to salmon stock management and the welfare of the southern resident killer whales.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930215">The recreational fishing impact on fish stocks is minimal. In the last few years, salmon stocks in B.C. have been healthy and are at record levels. In fact, some areas that are facing proposed closures are not even southern resident killer whale hunting grounds, indicating that there are other factors affecting the health of these important whales that are not being considered under this proposal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930216">Based on the catastrophic impact that this potential closure will have on small communities across British Columbia, I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to acknowledge the emergency in British Columbia and the recreational fishing industry by granting an emergency debate. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8930219">Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge that we are gathered today on the traditional and unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930220">I rise today to speak about how the legislative amendments proposed in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would continue to uphold our humanitarian tradition and due process while focusing resources on those who need them and improving confidence in our asylum system. These amendments would strengthen and streamline Canada's asylum and immigration systems. They include new rules related not only to whose asylum claim can be referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board for a decision, but also how claims are received, processed and decided.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930221">Under the legislation, the federal government would no longer refer claims to the Immigration and Refugee Board for an asylum claim decision for claims made more than one year after someone first arrives, after June 24, 2020, or claims made 14 or more days after someone enters Canada irregularly between border crossings. The amendments are designed to help protect our system against surges in claims, as well as people who want to use the asylum system to extend their stay in Canada when other mechanisms fail. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930222">They are not designed to turn away people with well-founded fear for their safety should they be returned to their home countries. In these instances, claims would be referred to the removal process, which includes the ability to seek a pre-removal risk assessment. Individuals can request this risk assessment when they believe they have a well-founded fear of removal to a situation where they would face persecution, torture or other grievous harm, for example. This safeguard gives us confidence that reforms to our asylum system do not undermine our commitment to protecting the world's most vulnerable people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930223">The risk assessment upholds Canada's obligations under international human rights and refugee conventions. It is a well-established mechanism that operates within a larger system today, providing an opportunity for those facing removal to demonstrate that they would be at risk of persecution or harm should they be removed. A risk assessment request might highlight information such as conditions in their home country or personal circumstances that make their return unsafe. These could be, for example, political and economic upheaval, armed conflict or shifting social dynamics in a country. Similarly, personal circumstances, such as visibility in activism or family dynamics, can heighten the risk of harm should they return. The risk assessment ensures that these factors are thoroughly reviewed before any removal order is carried out. It is conducted by trained officers who carefully evaluate the credibility and significance of the evidence presented. This is a rigorous process rooted in a deep understanding of risk and refugee law. The importance of having such a process cannot be overstated. Without it, we would lack a critical safety net, and there would be risk of irreversible harm to individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930224">Canada's pre-removal risk assessment process gives people a fair opportunity to submit evidence while ensuring that each case is deliberated with the seriousness that it deserves. The process is supported by a wealth of detailed data on country conditions and officers trained to evaluate risk with a high degree of expertise and sensitivity to individual circumstances. This underscores the importance of the pre-removal risk assessment process in maintaining Canada's strong history of refugee protection. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930225">The pre-removal risk assessment process also ensures that legislative changes made to our asylum system do not inadvertently expose individuals to harm. It acts as a backstop, allowing policy-makers to modernize and strengthen various aspects of our immigration framework while knowing that there is a fail-safe in place. Whether we are streamlining initial asylum decisions, addressing backlogs or modernizing pathways to protection, the pre-removal risk assessment remains an essential safeguard that gives us the confidence to innovate responsibly. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8930226">It is important to recognize that the risk assessment is not a tool for delaying lawful removals. Instead, it is about making sure that each person's case is reviewed against the most current information and circumstances so that there is a full consideration of the risks they face and no one is sent into harm's way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930227">This House has the important responsibility of ensuring that Canada's immigration and asylum systems reflect our values of compassion and fairness, while also meeting the needs of an evolving global context and addressing the pressures facing Canadians today. The pre-removal risk assessment process embodies this balance. It reassures Canadians that while we are taking urgent, necessary steps to strengthen our immigration system, we do so without compromising our commitment to protecting human life and dignity.</ParaText>

Does he not view those important measures as central for an asylum seeker and to ensure that Canada's asylum process is, indeed, independent, as opposed to one where decisions are made by the government's department?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8930239">Madam Speaker, I rise to speak today in strong opposition to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the so-called border security and immigration act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930240">Let us be clear: The bill is not a new approach. It is a repackaging, a political sleight of hand. Bill C-12 is simply Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> with a fresh coat of paint. It would not fix the fundamental problems of its predecessor. It doubles down on the same anti-migrant, anti-refugee agenda that civil society, legal experts and human rights advocates have already rejected in overwhelming numbers. More than 300 civil society organizations, from the Canadian Civil Liberties Association to the United Church of Canada, have called for the full withdrawal of both bills. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930241">The organizations are right, because Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would maintain the sweeping new powers in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> related to refugee asylum seekers, whereby the minister and cabinet, at the expense of transparency, fairness and human rights, could engage in a host of actions and would be given a host of authorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930242">Let us talk about some of the most egregious elements of the bill and what it would actually do. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would give cabinet the authority to suspend or terminate immigration applications and cancel visas, work permits or permanent resident documents whenever it is deemed to be “in the public interest”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930243">However, there is no definition of “public interest”, none; there are no guidelines, no guardrails, no requirements for evidence and no judicial oversight. The government could use this clause to shut down entire classes of immigration overnight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930244">As reported by the CBC, for people who apply under the humanitarian compassionate stream, the processing time right now is up to 600 months. That is 50 years. For caregivers, it is nine years; for the agri-food stream, it is 19 years. For entrepreneurs, it is 35 years. This is unheard of. By the way, all this came out of the minister's transition binder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930245"> The fear is that the government will just cancel applications en masse. That is what Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would allow the government to do. It is stoking fear. If the government wants to say that Canada wants to shut its door to asylum seekers, then it should just say that instead of doing this under the pretense that somehow this is just and fair and respects procedural fairness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930246">This is not good governance. It is not just the actions that the government might take with this kind of power that we should be concerned about. It would be giving that power to future governments as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930247">The bill also allows the government to block refugee hearings, to impose retroactive one-year bars on asylum claims and to strip people of their status en masse. These are powers that echo some of the most extreme anti-migrant policies we have seen south of the border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930248">The <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> likes to claim that this is about modernization and efficiency. It is not. It is peddling a racist, discriminatory narrative with Trump leading the charge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930249"> The bill would directly harm refugees and vulnerable migrants, people fleeing war, persecution and violence. Frankly, it is un-Canadian. Let us remember that Canada once prided itself on being a refuge for those in need. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> sends the opposite message. It says, “If you didn’t file your paperwork within a year, we don’t want to hear your case.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930250">We can imagine a woman fleeing gender-based violence, arriving in Canada with nothing, struggling with trauma, with no access to legal support, just trying to survive, and then being told she is too late to seek safety. As Women’s Shelters Canada and LEAF have pointed out, arbitrary timelines such as these deny survivors the ability to seek protection when they need it most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930251">We should be upholding the rule of law, not concentrating power in cabinet. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> represents a dangerous step backward. It undermines our international obligations, our charter values and our reputation as a country that welcomes those in need. The NDP stands with the hundreds of organizations across this country, civil liberties advocates, refugee lawyers, women’s groups and faith communities who are united in saying that we should withdraw Bill C-12 and Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930252">How can the government put forward legislation that will knowingly endanger survivors of violence or those being persecuted for who they love? Sixty-four countries criminalize homosexuality. That is not all. Under the U.S. administration, Trump's executive orders threaten the rights, the health care and the existence of transgender people. More and more, actually, my office has heard from people who are living in fear in the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930253"> Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is also a blow to civil liberties. It authorizes unprecedented information sharing across departments without proper safeguards. It empowers border agents to access private facilities and detain goods for export. It expands the Coast Guard’s role into intelligence collection and surveillance.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8930254">Even though the government removed some of the most intrusive measures from Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, such as the warrantless access to Canadians' private data, the spirit of the bill remains the same: centralization of power and erosion of rights. The International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group has warned that the bill “fast tracks...the most egregious aspects” of its predecessor. It would not fix the problems; it would accelerate them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930255">Let us not kid ourselves: Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> exists because Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> became too toxic to pass. Rather than listening to the hundreds of organizations demanding its withdrawal, the government chose to split the bill into two, hoping Canadians would not notice. However, we do notice. We notice that these measures come at a time when asylum claims have dropped by 34% and when the average number of daily refugee claims has plummeted from 165 to 12.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930256">What is the crisis, exactly, that the government is responding to? This is not about border security; it is about politics. It is about appeasing a Trump-style, anti-immigrant, anti-migrant narrative that is creeping into our political discourse. There is a dangerous pattern emerging under the current government, an obsession with centralizing authority and sidestepping accountability. It is carrying out the Conservatives' agenda but with a new Liberal leader dressed in red. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would expand cabinet's ability to rule by order. It would give ministers unilateral power to cancel applications, suspend rights and make regulations without parliamentary oversight. This is not the Canadian way. Our immigration and refugee system should be based on clear laws, fair processes and independent decision-making, not on who happens to sit in cabinet.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930257">Let us recognize who would bear the brunt of these policies: women fleeing violence, LGBTQ2+ refugees seeking safety, migrant workers exploited in precarious jobs and indigenous people in border communities, who already face racial profiling. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would deepen these inequalities instead of addressing them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930258">Let us make sure we do this right. When we talk about immigration, we are talking about people: families, workers and children who come here seeking safety and a better life. We should be strengthening our refugee system and not weakening it. The Liberals put women and girls at risk of being deported back into danger. The one-year bar is a copycat of the U.S. refugee determination system. Get this: In the U.S., the one-year timeline starts at their most recent entry into the United States. Canada's proposal is actually worse; it starts at the beginning, the first time they visit Canada. This means that if someone visited Canada some years ago as a child and they are now being persecuted, they will not be able to apply for asylum here in Canada, and that is wrong.</ParaText>

However, stripping people of their rights or putting women who face gender violence in danger is not the right way to go. Putting the lives of LGBTQ2 members in danger is not the way to go. Stripping refugees of their right to due process is not the way to go. In fact, I tabled a private member's bill calling for an immigration ombudsperson.

              <ParaText id="8930284"> Security is built on trust and respect among neighbours, including indigenous partners on the Canadian border. It is today’s newcomers learning Canada’s story, joining the work of reconciliation and building strong communities. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> can help us do all this if we get it right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930285">What does Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> do in a positive light? There are some things that we agree with. The Liberals have taken steps to strengthen some of the previous iterations of Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>. First, it enables CBSA to access and examine goods upstream, in warehouses and transportation hubs, not just at the last gate. Officers will be able to find contraband hidden deep in supply chains. Second, it accelerates listing the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl and other street drugs. Third, it improves information sharing among federal agencies, and affirms a coastal security role for the Canadian Coast Guard. This is critical across our vast shorelines and in the Arctic. Fourth, it clamps down on access to financial services by criminal networks that harm our communities. Finally, it helps to address the ongoing epidemic of crimes against indigenous women and girls by enabling information about sex offenders to be shared with indigenous police services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930286">Conservatives support many of these principles and aims because Canadians expect compassion, safety and accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930287">The toxic drug crisis demands urgency. Drug-related death and illness is a daily, unwelcome part of indigenous realities both on and off reserve and in our cities, where many indigenous people have chosen to live. This has had a devastating effect on current and future generations of indigenous people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930288">In Alberta, the toxic drug crisis is hitting indigenous people far harder than the general population, both on reserve and in cities. Despite first nations people being 3% to 4% of Alberta’s population, we accounted for 20% of opioid poisoning deaths between 2016 and 2022, and death rates have been reported at five to nine times higher than those of non-indigenous Albertans. When I was last chief, the ISC regional director reported the life expectancy for indigenous men in Alberta to be 58 years old, a nearly 20-year difference between Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930289">The urban impact is acute. From January to May 2025, Alberta saw a sharp rise in deaths involving carfentanil, with 68% of opioid fatalities province-wide and 78% in Edmonton involving carfentanil. The most toxic supply is concentrated in major centres where many indigenous people live, work and seek services. Organized trafficking networks exploit remote communities and urban corridors, causing loss of life every day. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8930290">The losses compound intergenerational trauma, housing and economic insecurity, and barriers to culturally safe care, ultimately the resources and capacity for nations to build self-sufficiency. Nationally, more than 53,000 apparent opioid deaths have been recorded since 2016, with B.C., Alberta and Ontario bearing most of the burden, regions with large indigenous populations both on and off reserve and in urban neighbourhoods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930291">The reasons are complex. They include racism in system of care, housing insecurity, unsupplied policing services, a poisoned drug supply and many more things. However, one part is clear: organized crime and transnational crime networks are flooding us with deadly products.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930292">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> could help to improve collaboration with indigenous police forces, such as the Blood Tribe Police Service’s drug task force, which conducts drug-trafficking investigations and seizures with the RCMP crime reduction unit near the U.S. border. It could also help other indigenous police forces follow the lead set by Akwesasne Mohawk Police, which deals with human trafficking and other smuggling across its internal borders between New York, Quebec and Ontario. There are also opportunities to collaborate among first nations, CBSA, RCMP and the Coast Guard to build capacity, share crime data, and enforce Canada’s laws and first nation laws on land and water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930293">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> could also help to disrupt human trafficking networks and prevent crimes against indigenous women and girls. RCMP-related agencies would be able to better track and share information about registered sex offenders with law enforcement partners, indigenous governments and U.S. partners, as well as facilitate disclosure of offender travel data. Strong cross-border and inter-agency sharing can help track high-risk offenders who move between jurisdictions that intersect with indigenous communities on and off reserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930294">I would like to acknowledge the Tsuut’ina Nation Police Service, which has worked with U.S. police forces. Doing this work is a real example of the leadership indigenous communities can show with their police forces this past year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930295">I ask the government to go beyond symbolic gestures using the tools provided in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>. After the Auditor General’s scathing reports about the government’s chronic failure to meet its fiduciary obligations to indigenous peoples, here is an opportunity to improve safety through collaboration and reconciliation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930296">In conclusion, security and reconciliation are not opposites They reinforce each other when we walk together and grow trust. We must work with indigenous leaders on safeguards, such as clear limits on secondary use of data, strengthening community relationships and cultural safety, and indigenous-led measures, so the expanded powers do not encourage racial profiling or erode trust. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> gives tools to make Canada safer if we work together with other communities, rural communities, rural Canadians and indigenous communities near our borders, our cities and beyond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930297">I encourage my colleagues to work in committee to amend this bill to better defend our borders and deepen our bonds through trust and security. Even with the Liberals' second attempt at such a bill, it still fails to address things such as bail reform. Catch and release is alive and well for those who traffic in fentanyl and firearms, as well as those who are using our porous border to victimize Canadians. Sentencing provisions have not been included as much as they should be. There are still no mandatory prison times for fentanyl traffickers. There are still no new mandatory prison times for gangsters who use guns to commit crimes, despite the Liberals' campaign against legal gun owners. House arrest is still permissible for some of the most serious offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930298">Liberals continue to push for safe consumption sites near schools. At the health committee, my hon. colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="317739" Type="2">Riding Mountain</Affiliation>, called on the Liberals to shut down fentanyl consumption sites next to children. This is a common-sense measure. However, the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="318692" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> refused to rule out approving more consumption sites next to schools and day cares, despite acknowledging they are repositories for rampant fentanyl usage.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8930312">Madam Speaker, before I dive into my comments on Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, I want to acknowledge that I was here 11 years ago on this date, October 22, when Parliament came under attack by a lone gunman. I want to publicly thank the Parliamentary Protective Service and the RCMP for the safety they provided to all members of the House. </ParaText>

Constable Samearn Son took a shot to the foot here in Parliament, and Constable Curtis Barrett was able to neutralize the threat. I want to acknowledge those individuals as well. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930314">The Liberal government is asking Canadians to believe that Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is different from Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> and is a new safeguard for the country. It is not. Behind the new title lies the same design: more intrusion, more bureaucracy and less freedom for Canadians. Conservatives will stand as the barrier between Canadians and any act that weakens their privacy or erodes their freedoms, and mistakes government control for public safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930315">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> must be fixed. When Conservatives forced the government to withdraw Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, it was more than another Liberal failure. That bill sought to give cabinet sweeping authority to collect and share potential personal data without judicial oversight. By stopping it, we reminded the government and our country that freedom in Canada is not a privilege granted by the government but a charter right, which we will not tolerate being trampled on by the Liberal government. The withdrawal of Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> proved that a determined opposition can still discipline a government that has grown careless with its authority and abuse of power. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930316">When drafting Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, the government did not consult the Privacy Commissioner before proposing to grant itself warrant-free access to Canadians' financial and digital records. The text of Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, and now echoes of it in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, envisioned power to retrieve information from banks and telecommunications providers as the “Minister considers necessary”. Wow. There would be no court order, no independent review and no safeguard against those kinds of abuses. A government that can reach into private accounts and call it protection is not defending citizens; it is blatant overreach. Rather than protection, it is control over them, and Canadians deserve better than governance by surveillance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930317">Law-abiding Canadians should not forfeit their freedoms to pay for the government's negligence at the border. Years of weak enforcement and negligent immigration management have left Canada vulnerable to the very criminal networks that the bill claims to confront. Rather than tightening entry controls, the government has turned inward, treating every citizen as a potential suspect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930318">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is not a defence of sovereignty, but an admission that the government has been unable or unwilling to control those who seek to enter illegally, so it will instead attempt to control its citizens. Until the government can provide the security and protection of our freedoms and sovereignty, Canadians will be the ones who bear the consequences of bad Liberal policies, policies they never asked for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930319">Years ago, Justin Trudeau said that he admired what he called the “basic dictatorship” of Communist China. Those remarks were not casual. They revealed a mindset that efficiency matters more than consent, that control is strength and that democracy is a hindrance to decisive rule. Yet again, the Liberal government is demonstrating that it still thinks like Justin Trudeau. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930320">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> carries the same impulse. Translated into law, it hides coercion in the language of administration. It expands government access to personal data, centralizes authority in ministerial hands and calls this intrusion public safety. The bill would empower officials to require any person to provide any information relevant to the minister's determination. These are not targeted, investigative powers; they are open-ended instruments of surveillance disguised as administration. Canadians should believe the Liberals when they say things like this. The Liberal project has been to replace accountability with administrative control, one regulation, one surveillance clause and one warrantless power at a time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930321">Now the government has returned with Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, revised in wording, but unchanged in purpose. Canadians have learned what that means: less privacy, more bureaucracy and another significant overreach into their lives under the banner of safety.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8930322">We will examine every line, every clause and every authority that Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would grant. We will ensure there are no hidden regulations that would turn oversight into surveillance. We are not a passive opposition; we are now the country's safeguard in Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930323">Canadians may have elected the Liberal government, but we will still protect them from its overreach. We will defend their right to live free from suspicion, to transact without intrusion and to remain citizens, not data points in a government database.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930324">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would do nothing to correct the failures of the bail system, which releases violent offenders back into our streets. A government serious about justice would not tolerate repeat offenders moving drugs and weapons while communities bear the costs. The reality is that Canadians are living with the consequences of a system that mistakes leniency for progress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930325">True public safety begins with control of the border and certainty of punishment. Those who traffic fentanyl, smuggle weapons or endanger lives must face penalties appropriate to the crime and ones that will keep our citizens safe. A government that fails to enforce its own law creates conditions for chaos. A nation that cannot or will not secure its border cannot guarantee the security of its people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930326">On sentencing, the failures are unmistakable. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> leaves untouched the absence of mandatory prison time for those who traffic in fentanyl, an offence that destroys Canadian families and communities every single day. It introduces no new mandatory penalties for gang members who commit crimes with illegal firearms. The government imposes restrictions on law-abiding hunters and farmers while failing to strengthen penalties for those who commit crimes with illegal firearms, which is by far the vast majority of gun-related crimes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930327">This inversion of justice reveals a deeper problem: the failure to connect law with consequence. Deterrence works only when punishment is certain and proportionate. Without it, every sentence becomes a suggestion and every criminal learns that Canada will forgive what it refuses to prevent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930328">A government that governs without moral distinction cannot preserve order. When there is virtually no distinction between crime and compliance and they are treated alike, the rule of law decays. Canadians do not ask for vengeance; they ask for accountability. They ask for a justice system that protects the innocent, restrains the violent, re-establishes moral clarity in law and provides appropriate punishments for criminals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930329">Even for serious violent offences, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would continue to permit house arrest. A criminal who has shattered lives should not complete punishment on the couch in his living room playing Xbox. The government calls this rehabilitation. In truth, it signals that consequences have been replaced by convenience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930330">When justice no longer imposes real cost on wrongdoing, crime becomes just another risk of the trade for those who profit from it. For those who are accountants and listening today, criminals do a cost-benefit analysis as well and have obviously determined that under the Liberal justice system, the cost is worth the potential benefit. This is so wrong. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930331">The measure of justice is not leniency but credibility. Every time the government offers comfort to those who destroy others' lives, it destroys the authority of law and the safety of the public. If the government will not restore the proportion between crime and punishment, Parliament must. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930332">The government's tolerance of so-called safe consumption sites near schools is a direct failure of responsibility and is abhorrent. No responsible nation permits narcotics facilities near schools and describes it as public health policy. These neighbourhoods deserve order, not policy experimentation presented as compassion by a woke government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930333">What the government calls harm reduction has become harm relocation, shifting the crisis from alleyways to doorsteps and from addicts to families. Leadership demands drawing lines, and the first line must always be to protect the innocent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930334">Canadians are watching a government that punishes the law-abiding citizen while excusing repeat offenders. It expands bureaucracy, weakens enforcement and governs through regulation instead of principle. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930335">The Conservatives stand for something different. We stand for a nation where law protects the innocent, not the offender, where privacy belongs to the citizen, not to the government, and where power is exercised under restraint, not carelessly or impulsively. Real leadership defends the public without breaking its confidence. Real justice distinguishes guilt from innocence instead of confusing both through bureaucratic process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930336">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> fails every one of those tests. It would add layers of control but no layers of accountability.

              <ParaText id="8930359">Madam Speaker, after 10 years of Liberal failure, Canadians now face a cost of living crisis, a crime crisis, a housing crisis and a border crisis, and the government has the nerve to stand up here today and pretend that Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> will strengthen Canada's immigration systems and borders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930360">This bill will not fix our immigration system and does not protect Canadians. It does little to stop the flow of fentanyl, guns, gangsters or illegal crossings, and most certainly does not defend the rights and freedoms of law-abiding Canadians. This bill is the second attempt at a failed Liberal bill, Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, which, of course, the Liberals did not spend much time working on over the summer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930361">Before we even get into Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, we have to remember how we got here. About a month ago, the Liberals tried to ram through Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, which would have given them sweeping, warrantless powers to seize Canadians' personal information from banks and telecoms. There would be no warrants, judicial oversight, transparency or respect for the charter or Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930362">It was so abusive, invasive and offensive to our democratic tradition that the Privacy Commissioner confirmed the Liberals did not even bother to consult him. The Liberals planned a mass surveillance power grab and hoped Canadians would not notice. The Liberals got caught and Conservatives forced them to back down, go back to the drawing board and rewrite this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930363">That is the only reason we are debating Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> today, because the Liberals' first attempt was exposed as a direct assault on Canadians' privacy, freedom and basic civil liberties. Law-abiding Canadians will not be treated like criminals just because Liberals cannot control the border that they themselves have broken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930364">Now the Liberals are back with Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, promising that this time it is different. Conservatives scrutinize every line, every clause, every hidden catch, to ensure the Liberals are not sneaking in another assault on Canadians' rights, freedoms and civil liberties. The Liberal government has forfeited the benefit of the doubt. The Liberal government tried once to spy on Canadians without a warrant; only a fool would trust them a second time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930365">This bill barely touches on the number one border threat facing this country: the illegal flow of fentanyl, weapons and violent criminals across our border. It makes no mention of the badly needed bail reform to the Liberals' catch-and-release, revolving-door injustice system. It makes no reference to mandatory prison sentences when the Liberals brought house arrest to dozens of serious crimes, cracking down on fentanyl traffickers and gangs doing drive-bys in our once-safe neighbourhoods or hiring more CBSA officers, which the Liberals promised to do in their election platform. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930366">Under the Liberal government, drug traffickers walk free on house arrest, gangsters avoid mandatory jail time and repeat violent offenders are released again and again under Liberal catch-and-release bail. None of this will stop a single fentanyl dealer or gun smuggler with real punishments and consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930367">The government actually believes that someone trafficking poison into our communities should be able to serve their sentence at home, on the couch, watching TV. Remember, the Liberals legalized hard drugs, they brought in taxpayer-funded hard drugs and flooded them into our streets and they also brought in drug consumption sites.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930368">Conservatives believe that fentanyl traffickers and drug kingpins should be in prison and those possessing 40 milligrams or more should be treated like the mass murderers they are and should receive life imprisonment, yet this bill does absolutely nothing to change that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930369">The Liberals obsess over legal gun owners while doing absolutely nothing to put the gangsters behind bars. The Liberals target law-abiding hunters and farmers while letting fentanyl traffickers out on bail. It is backward and dangerous, and Canadians are paying the price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930370">While this border crisis spreads fentanyl into our communities, the Liberals are opening and defending drug consumption sites near schools and playgrounds.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930371">Conservatives demanded not too long ago that the Liberals shut down overdose sites next to locations with children. What did the <Affiliation DbId="318692" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> have to say? They refused to rule out approving more drug-injection sites, even though they acknowledged that these sites are filled with rampant fentanyl use.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8930372">The Liberals will not reverse the policies that got us into this mess in the first place. The Liberals will not jail fentanyl traffickers. The Liberals will not stop illegal border flows. The Liberals will not ever protect school zones from drug consumption sites. This is not compassion; it is government-orchestrated chaos.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930373">Let us talk about the reality that Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> pretends it would address, but would not. Canada now has three million temporary residents, over 7% of our population, and that number is going up every day. Canada now has 500,000 undocumented individuals, and that number is also going up every day. Canada has 300,000 asylum claims in the queue, and of course that is also growing every day. The result is that our housing market is collapsing, our health care is collapsing, our job market is collapsing and our communities are simply overwhelmed. The Liberals created chaos, and now they want more power, not to fix it, but to cover up the mess they made.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930374">Let us not forget how much this border crisis is costing taxpayers. Conservatives uncovered just how badly the Liberals have mismanaged the interim federal health program. Under their Liberal government, federal health care costs for asylum claimants have exploded to $456 million per year, representing a 1,186% increase since 2016. Coverage includes benefits that many Canadians pay for out of pocket or do not receive at all, including vision care, counselling, physiotherapy, assistive devices, home care, nursing homes and pharmaceuticals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930375"> Canadians are a compassionate people, but is it really fair for non-citizens to get health care coverage that Canadians themselves do not receive?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930376">There has been a 376% increase in claims and a 1,100% increase in reimbursements since the Liberals took office. The Liberals spent $1.1 billion on hotels for asylum claimants and gave $1.5 billion more to provinces for refugee costs, while Canadian citizens wait in ER hallways, seniors cannot get long-term care and families cannot find a family doctor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930377"> Canadians are compassionate, but is it really fair that non-citizens get better benefits than Canadians and law-abiding newcomers alike who have paid their taxes and paid their dues their entire lives? Only the Liberals could think that was an acceptable situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930378">The Liberal <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his Liberal MPs have created a system where Canadians wait, Canadians sacrifice, Canadians pay and everyone else gets priority. Canadians have been paying into our health care system for their entire lives. Our seniors and families all across Canada deserve to reap the rewards of their hard work by getting health care when they need it. Instead, our health care system is already overwhelmed and overcapacity, and Canadian seniors cannot get the treatment they need. It is not sustainable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930379"> Canadians are a proud and caring people, but unvalidated asylum seekers should not be getting better benefits than Canadians do. We need immediate reform. The Liberals call that compassion, but I call it betrayal of Canadian taxpayers. This is not sustainable, it is not fair and Canadians expect more from this Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930380">Let us expose this bill's failures every step of the way and make sure that it works for Canadians. Conservatives will always stand up for secure borders; privacy and freedom; jail, not bail for fentanyl traffickers and violent criminals; no more drug sites next to schools; and an immigration system that is fair, sustainable and puts Canadians first. Because compassion must have limits, immigration must be lawful and sovereignty must be preserved. This country is worth fighting for. Our borders matter, our safety matters, our freedom matters, our privacy matters and Canadians matter. Conservatives will always stand up and fight for hard-working Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930381"> The Liberals continue to distract from a border crisis, a crime crisis and an immigration crisis entirely of the Liberal government's making. The bill would not fix the problem; it would not stop the flow of drugs, guns, gangs or illegal crossings that are flowing over the border at record levels. We will not let the Liberals use the bill as a back door to violate the privacy, rights and freedoms of Canadians again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930382"> Conservatives will fight for Canadians. We will fight to restore public safety on our streets, secure our border, restore our sovereignty and put Canadians first once again.</ParaText>

To be very clear, the injection sites are the provinces' responsibility, and they are the ones that ultimately give consent as to where those injection sites go. The Conservatives are saying that Ottawa should override a provincial responsibility, but they do not say that. Instead, they try to give the impression that the federal government wants injection sites by playgrounds, which is just wrong, and I find in the comments they often give in the speeches the same sort of thing.

              <ParaText id="8930419">As parliamentarians, we are obliged to uphold international law, and that includes international conventions that we are signatories to, including for international human rights that grant asylum seekers the right to seek protection from prosecution. This is most notable in article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the 1951 Refugee Convention. A core principle is non-refoulement, which means that countries are prohibited from returning refugees to a place where their life or freedom is at risk. Countries are obliged to assess asylum claims fairly and protect refugees from being sent back to danger.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8930422"> This is a fundamental principle: the principle of non-refoulement. This fundamental principle of international law is also found in other international human rights treaties that we are signatories to.

This is considered a customary international law that applies to all countries.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8930436">Today Divya helped me research and write this speech. Obviously, I added the partisan side of my speech myself because interns have to remain non-partisan during their time with us. I wanted to warn people that some of the passages are my own creation. I congratulate all the interns on their achievements and thank the organizers and sponsors of this wonderful program, which gives young Canadians the opportunity to experience first-hand the decision-making process on our beautiful Parliament Hill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930437">Let me get back to today's topic, namely Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C‑12</Document>. Before going into the details of the bill, I would like to take a step back and look at the big picture of what this Liberal government has done in 10 years. Since this <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was elected, I believe that we have witnessed the largest pothole repair operation in Canadian history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930438">What is a pothole? After a long, hard winter, when the snow melts, we discover that our roads are full of holes. There are big ones, little ones, huge ones and potholes in the making. There are holes everywhere, especially in the municipalities. Just before summer, at the turn of spring, municipal road crews get to work filling as many holes as possible as quickly as possible to keep them from getting bigger, to prevent cars from breaking down and to ensure pedestrians do not get hurt. I have no doubt that all this is done with the best of intentions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930439">However, anything goes when it comes to filling holes. They act quickly. They know that what they are repairing will not really be repaired because it is just a quick fix. They will have to come back a little later. They intervene for appearances' sake, knowing full well that the repairs are cosmetic, which means that instead of being fixed, the problem will get worse year after year. The following year, they will have to come back because the hole will be a little bigger. If it is only a quick fix, they will have to come back again the year after that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930440">What does this have to do with Bill C‑12? Before the members opposite ask me that question, I will explain. It is very simple. It is as though we are coming out of an extremely long 10-year winter during which the Liberals dug holes everywhere. There are potholes in every department after 10 years of Liberal mismanagement. Whether we are talking about justice, immigration, passports or delays at the Canada Revenue Agency, there are potholes everywhere after the long Liberal winter. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930441">I did not talk about the biggest pothole of all, and that is the country's finances. That is the biggest pothole of all with a deficit that has doubled and inflationary spending that has created many smaller holes in the pockets of all Canadians, who can no longer make ends meet at the end of the month. Canadians are $200 away from being in the red, from no longer being able to pay their bills at the end of the month. They are struggling and they are being forced to make tough choices at the grocery store.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930442">Today, the Liberals would have us believe that spring is right around the corner. They have looked under the snow after 10 years in power, and what they saw was really not pretty. Their woke Liberal ideological policies have caused a great deal of damage, and Canadians will be left to pay the price for years to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930443">As I said, a pothole repair operation is a superficial fix that is not used to repair holes for good, but rather to simply fill them in. After how badly Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> failed, Bill C‑12 is a superficial fix to tackle the damage caused by the Liberals over the past 10 years. By the way, this part was not written by my intern. I just want to clarify that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8930444">Let us talk about immigration. The government made our businesses dependent on temporary foreign workers. Now, with Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the government is going to punish the very people it made promises to when they decided to come settle here in Canada. This is not just about compassion. It is contradictory. The government made our businesses dependent on these workers and now it is trying to break that dependency without a plan, leaving businesses and workers in limbo. Most importantly, the government is forgetting that those affected are human beings with children, families and a dream, a dream of settling in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930445">In the beginning, the temporary foreign worker program had the very specific goal of addressing temporary labour shortages. However, under the Liberals, this program grew and it became a permanent solution to problems that the government refused to address. This program was working well and meeting its objectives, but the Liberals created so much chaos and neglected the program so much that, today, people who should be able to go through the proper channels no longer have time to do so because the system is so broken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930446">Bill C‑12 is not fixing the problem of temporary workers. This bill would make it harder for all these people, whom we welcomed with open arms after the former prime minister sent a tweet inviting them to come to Canada. This message was heard across the country, but today, it is making many people unhappy. We have all heard about it in our riding offices. This improvised approach hurt people, it hurt families and it hurt businesses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930447">After a decade of the Liberals' absolutely disastrous mismanagement of the immigration system, the number of refugee claims has risen to 296,000 today. That is huge. Think about it. Ten years ago, we only had 10,000 and now, we have 296,000. At the current pace, it would take the government 25 years to process the 296,000 pending files. Let that sink in. It is absolutely unacceptable. It is a disaster. The Liberal government's attitude to immigration as a whole has created some really desperate situations that are heartbreaking for the people experiencing them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930448">Let us now turn our attention to crime. I will let the numbers speak for themselves. After 10 years of Liberal governance, the total number of violent crimes is up 49.84%. Homicides are up 28%. Gang-related homicides are up 78%. Sexual assaults are up 74%. Extortion is up 357%. What action did the Liberals take last winter to protect Canadians? They took no action. On the contrary, they made the situation worse by passing legislation like Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, which set criminals loose, let abusers serve their sentences at home and forced judges to let criminals go as fast as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930449">Sadly, since taking office seven months ago, this <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has done nothing to act on his promises. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> may close a few loopholes, but it will not quiet the fears of Canadians who have never before seen their country change as much as it has in the past 10 years of this long Liberal winter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930450">Time is flying by. The Liberals would have us believe that spring is coming. However, they have not even started fixing the potholes, and winter already seems to be right around the corner. Never before have we seen a pothole repair be botched so badly. This <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised to spend less, but he is spending twice as much as his predecessor. He promised to maintain the deficit, but we now know that it will be much bigger than the one predicted by Canada's most spendthrift prime minister before him. They are not repairing potholes; they are digging more and making them bigger. We were seeing the first signs of spring, but instead we are in for another storm of Liberal spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930451">Just today, the Prime Minister confirmed in the House that he will run a generational deficit on November 4. They are not fooling us. Bill C‑12 will plug a few holes, but the root causes of the Liberal legacy of the past 10 years will unfortunately remain.</ParaText>

After the pro forma throne speech, Bill <Document DbId="13539341" Type="3">C-1</Document>, came Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>.

              <ParaText id="8930508"> He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Motion No. 14, a motion that embodies a simple but powerful idea, that Canada's generosity abroad should also help build opportunities at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930509">For decades, Canadians have led with compassion, building schools, strengthening food systems, empowering women and literally saving lives across the world. We have done so not for recognition but because it is who we are. As the world changes, our development approach must change with it. We must continue to be generous but we must also be strategic, innovative and accountable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930510">The global development landscape has evolved dramatically. Today, many donor countries are pulling back, according to the OECD's 2024 report. International development assistance dollars have declined for the first time in years. Several major countries facing domestic pressures have cut back their international development dollars to the tune of billions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930511">Canada must not follow that path. We must do what we do best but do it even better. We must stay engaged, stay innovative and make our international assistance work for both our partners and our people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930512">The global economy is shifting. Emerging markets are no longer just recipients of aid; they are engines of growth. They are innovators. They are our trading partners. Nine out of the top 20 fastest-growing economies this year are in Africa. Countries like Rwanda, Niger, Senegal and Côte d'Ivoire are experiencing growth rates of between 6% to 11% per year. ln Asia, the ASEAN region is now the fastest-growing economic bloc in the world, even surpassing the G7 on a per capita basis. In these regions, Canada has a depth of credibility. We are seen as long-term partners who have been there through thick and thin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930513">The first pillar of Motion No. 14 calls on us to embed reciprocal economic benefit within Canada's international assistance program. This is not about turning aid into trade. lt is about aligning our compassion with our capabilities. When a Canadian clean energy start-up helps deploy solar microgrids in a Caribbean country, it not only lowers emissions abroad but it helps create skilled jobs right here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930514">When a Canadian agri-tech firm supports farmers in producing more and higher yields in East Africa, we not only get to tackle hunger over there but we also help Canada's agricultural innovation sector. When our colleges deliver digital skills training, we not only empower youth in the developing world, we also continue to enhance Canada's reputation as a leader in education. This pillar ensures that Canadian innovation becomes part of the world's solution to global challenges while ensuring that Canadians share in the opportunity that innovation creates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930515">The second pillar proposes the creation of a dedicated economic partnerships window. This window would bridge Canada's development priorities and our domestic economic strengths. lt would support projects that advance poverty reduction and sustainable development abroad. It would strengthen Canadian sectors such as clean energy, agriculture, digital technology and education. It would mobilize small and medium-sized enterprises to become global problem-solvers. We already have glimpses of what this model looks like through FinDev Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8930516">In 2022, FinDev invested $8 million U.S. in the Central American small enterprise investment fund, which supports high-growth SMEs in the agri-food, manufacturing, education and information technology sectors in Central America and the Caribbean. The fund focuses on job creation, women's economic empowerment and local value chains.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8930517">In 2025, FinDev invested $15 million U.S. in EcoEnterprises Partners, a women-led impact fund backing 20 SMEs in Latin America working in agritech, renewable energy, sustainable forestry and biodiversity conservation. This is exactly the kind of clean-growth collaboration this motion envisions. In Colombia, FinDev partnered with IDB Invest and the U.S. DFC on a $319-million U.S. facility with Banco Davivienda, expanding financing for small and women-led businesses and for green projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930518">These examples prove that Canadian finance, innovation and know-how can generate shared prosperity. A dedicated economic partnerships window would scale up this model by opening more pathways for Canadian SMEs and workers to plug into these global value chains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930519">The third pillar of Motion No. 14 would strengthen accountability. lt would require the minister of international development to report annually to Parliament on the extent of Canadian participation in international development projects. It would also require the minister to table measurable benefits for partner countries, as well as economic opportunities created for Canadians right here at home. This transparency would ensure that every dollar of development assistance delivers a real impact, measurable progress and tangible benefits, both abroad and at home. lt would turn good intentions into accountable outcomes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930520">This motion is not about changing who we are; it is about strengthening who we always have been. Canadians are compassionate, but we are also innovative, entrepreneurial and globally minded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930521">Motion No. 14 reflects a modern, confident Canada, one that sees international development not as a cost, but as an investment in shared prosperity. lt tells the world that partnership is the future of aid and that Canada's economic security and global solidarity go hand in hand. By aligning our values with our strengths, we can make every act of assistance an act of opportunity in the world for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930522">I want to conclude by saying that I have seen first-hand the impact that Canadian international development and assistance programs have had on people's lives. From allowing people to access education and clean water to encouraging entrepreneurship and hope, Canada has always been a global leader in this field. What this motion seeks to do is build on that proud tradition and propel it into the future. lt would ensure our aid remains generous, effective and accountable, but also smart, strategic and innovative</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930523"> When we help others, we rise with them, so let us pass Motion No. 14 and make Canada's international development policy a model of shared progress for a changing world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8930538">Mr. Speaker, after 10 years of this Liberal government, we have seen nothing but consistent reckless spending. From arrive scam to the green slush fund of the last Parliament, Liberals just cannot seem to stop giving away taxpayer dollars to their friends and allies. We are six months post-election, and nothing has changed. With conflict of interest breaches circling the current <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Canadians are in for another season of more Liberals getting rich off their wasted taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930539"> I say all this as a preamble to the discussion at hand today on Motion No. 14, which is about Canada’s international development assistance. After I read the motion, I reflected. This is from our current Liberal government. Words like “accountability” and “effectiveness” seem distant from the actions of the current and previous Liberal administrations. Under Conservative governments, these were not merely words, but pillars in the Conservative approach to international development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930540"> The <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is looking to “rein in spending”. As our <Affiliation DbId="322132" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> has said, that is a goal worth co-operating on. Under the Liberal government, international development programming has been seen as overly generous, to the point of being wasteful. Programs have not been yielding results and have been ideologically leaning toward woke causes. There have also been reports of abuse and of development funding being misappropriated by terrorist groups or organizations sympathetic to terrorist causes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930541"> The words and actions of this government are at odds. As Canadians struggle with high taxes, record food bank usage and an unaffordability crisis, the <Affiliation DbId="318709" Type="5">Secretary of State for International Development</Affiliation> recently announced nearly $140 million in overseas funding. Motion No. 14 serves as a request for the oversight the Liberals neglected when they got into power 10 years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930542">Canada’s commitment to international assistance is rooted in decades of real-world impact. Conservative governments in particular have often pioneered focused, high-impact initiatives. By examining a few historical case studies, we can draw lessons on what works and what a Conservative-led development policy should champion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930543"> One of the clearest examples of focused Canadian aid delivering results was Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s maternal, newborn and child health initiative, launched at the G8 Muskoka summit in 2010. In the face of high mortality rates among mothers and young children in developing countries, Canada rallied global partners to take decisive action. The Harper government committed a total of $2.85 billion over five years to improve maternal and child health, including $1.1 billion in new funding and $1.75 billion in renewed support, establishing this as a long-term Canadian priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930544">This infusion of resources went to practical interventions like training health workers, funding immunizations and building clinics in some of the world’s poorest regions. Just as important as the money was an emphasis on outcomes. As Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced, “Accountability for results will be an integral part of Canada’s contribution”. He announced this with a rigorous framework to measure progress and ensure aid dollars are used effectively. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930545">That accountability paid off. Alongside other donors, Canada’s push helped save countless lives by expanding vaccination programs and maternal care, contributing to a significant drop in the under-five mortality rate globally in the early 2010s. I have seen first-hand the benefits of freshwater well sites and maternal health clinics and the positive impact they have had in the communities in Tanzania. The people are grateful, and they want more of this type of support. Because of a Conservative initiative, their lives have been measurably improved permanently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930546">The Muskoka initiative demonstrated how a Conservative government’s focus on a clear priority, coupled with demand for results, could mobilize the world. Canada once led the way in mobilizing support among G8 and non-G8 leaders, key donors and private foundations to tackle this challenge. This legacy guides our vision. We will target aid to where it makes a measurable difference, in this case the health of mothers and children, while insisting on transparency and effectiveness in every dollar spent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930547"> Another example of international development done right was in 2014, after Russia’s first incursion into Ukraine. When Ukraine’s sovereignty came under attack, Prime Minister Harper took swift action, condemning Russian aggression and backing words with aid.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8930548">In March 2014, Canada announced a package of over $220 million to help Ukraine stabilize its economy and support democratic development. This assistance, delivered as loans and grants, helped the new Ukrainian government pay its bills and implement reforms during a pivotal moment of transition. Canada also deployed hundreds of election observers and provided technical support to bolster Ukraine's fragile democracy. The message was clear: Canadians stand with those fighting for their freedom and self-determination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930549">Canada currently spends over $8 billion annually on foreign aid. At a time when so many Canadians are struggling to make ends meet, this number should be much lower. We should also be transitioning from government handouts to partnerships that benefit Canadian interests and bolster our economy. This is something the motion proposes, but we will have to wait and see if the government can follow through.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930550">In the text of the motion, we read that the government will be, “establishing a dedicated Economic Partnerships Window to support projects that align poverty reduction abroad with economic security at home”. Unfortunately, as we have seen in the last 10 years, the Liberal government has a habit of creating more bureaucracy. Consider the newly announced Build Canada Homes, a new government body that plans to build 4,000 factory-built affordable homes at a price tag of $13 billion, or $3.25 million a house.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930551">If the government is serious about producing results, it will ensure that the economic partnerships window is not another opportunity to balloon the government. The mission, expectations and outcomes for the economic partnerships window need to be crystal clear. It should also be funded from the current international development budget and not require the taxpayer to shoulder more debt. The required parliamentary report from the Minister of International Development is a welcome addition to this motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930552">The Liberals put up frequent roadblocks and have maintained a general, pervasive mentality away from transparency that has made it difficult for the official opposition to hold the Liberal government accountable and give Canadians the information that they deserve. Name the scandal or issue, whether it is inflation, the economy, crime or food prices, the Liberals have shown no accountability for anything or remorse for the harm they have caused. If this motion is serious, it will usher a shift in Liberal policy, championing transparency over secrecy and issue avoidance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930553">Canada is a generous nation, but there is room to strengthen our leadership. The motion is in no way innovative; the actions highlighted within should never have been abandoned in the first place. When dealing with taxpayer funds, accountability should be the first consideration, not an afterthought. Global Affairs Canada has rightly earned the reputation for being one of the highest wastefully spending departments. Motion No. 14 could be a signal to the end of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930554">There is a right and wrong way of stewarding the public purse. Conservatives have a strong record of doing it the right way; the Liberals, not so much. Given the history of Liberal waste, I cautiously give my support for this motion. The economic partnerships window should not cost the taxpayer more. If accountability is the new way forward, the international development budget should cover this initiative.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930555">Let us see if this becomes a model for other departments to follow or if this will be another scandal that Conservatives will need to unearth down the line. For now, we are going to give co-operation a chance, and I look forward to working with the member on his motion going forward.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8930556">Mr. Speaker, in 2023, the Auditor General noted that Global Affairs Canada had failed to demonstrate whether its $3.5 billion in annual development assistance, allocated under the government's feminist policy, had improved the lives of women and girls. Furthermore, only half of the projects funded were included in the annual reports to Parliament. It was therefore impossible for the department to properly report on the results of the projects it funded. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930557">The motion moved by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="317966" Type="2">York South—Weston—Etobicoke</Affiliation> demonstrates a desire to improve performance measurements in order to determine whether investments are producing the desired outcomes. The third paragraph calls on the Minister of International Development to table an annual report in Parliament to measure the effectiveness of international assistance and its impact at home. As we know, the Bloc Québécois is in favour of greater transparency, especially when it comes to how the money of Quebec and Canadian families is being spent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930558">In its election platform, the Bloc Québécois proposed investing 0.7% of gross national income in international assistance, albeit with better monitoring of investments and priority given to issues such as education, health, climate change adaptation and poverty reduction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930559">It is crucial to recognize that assistance is also a cost-effective investment that plays a fundamental role in global stability. It is often criticized, and rightly so, because it generates so much red tape, carries colonialist overtones and can be weaponized for political purposes. Nonetheless, assistance is still the only mechanism for transferring resources internationally and the only framework we have right now for co-operation and maintenance of international standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930560">However, I must point out that, under the Liberals, the Canadian government has achieved the unenviable feat of doing worse than Stephen Harper's government in terms of international assistance. In addition, Canada failed miserably at securing a seat on the UN Security Council after mounting a last-minute campaign in 2020. Experts attribute this failure in part to Canada's abandonment of humanitarian assistance. Canada currently spends 0.3% of its GDP on international assistance. The UN asks countries like Canada to contribute 0.7%. The average for OECD countries ranges from 0.4% to 0.44% of GDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930561">We are doing worse under the Liberals than we were under the Harper government. The government that has been the most stingy in terms of providing support for international human rights as a percentage of GDP is the current government, or the old government, as the Liberals like to remind us. It is six of one, half a dozen of the other.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930562">As we know, Canada is not a military or economic power. However, it can play a role in humanitarian assistance and international development. Under commitments made by the UN in 1970, Canada must increase the amount it spends on official development assistance to 0.7% of its gross national income. By the federal government's own admission, however, Canada has no plan to reach the 0.7% target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930563">While international assistance is often criticized for all the red tape it generates, it is also important to acknowledge the benefits to the countries receiving and providing the aid.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8930568">Mr. Speaker, as I was saying, my colleague's motion assumes that international assistance can have a positive impact on our domestic economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930569">The motion does not say that the government should stop funding international organizations or put a stop to more traditional assistance, but rather that it should encourage projects that are mutually beneficial. On this point, we agree.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930570">Of course, there is no denying that corruption is present in the development assistance sector. In our view, by ensuring that international assistance benefits businesses here as well, we can mitigate the risk that funds will be misspent due to corruption. We would also be ensuring that some of the money stays in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930571">Still, make no mistake: Provided that the money is properly invested, development assistance is not a waste of public funds. This is partly why I support my colleague's motion. However, I do have some concerns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930572">I am concerned that the Liberal government is using the motion as a way to withdraw from international assistance. I am concerned that the government's economic ambitions will unfortunately influence its decisions on funding international assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930573">Yes, funding projects that provide reciprocal economic benefits can be a way to help other countries while keeping some of the money in our economy. However, I fear that the federal government is looking only at the economic benefits, without considering any other official development assistance objectives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930574">For example, it is not hard to imagine the Liberal government funding mining companies abroad under the pretext that it creates jobs, even though we are well aware of many horror stories about local populations being exploited, not to mention all the other impacts it can have on communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930575">I am also concerned that the smaller players in the development assistance sector will be at a disadvantage when it comes to securing funding for their projects, which may be smaller but are just as important and beneficial for communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930576">My riding is home to the Centre de solidarité internationale du Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean. It is headquartered in Alma and does exceptional work. Its work is often very concrete and measurable, and it has a direct, local impact on the people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930577">That is why the Bloc Québécois would like to amend the motion moved today in order to emphasize the role of non-profit organizations and small international co-operation centres.

While the motion encourages the integration of reciprocal economic benefits into our international development assistance, I want to be clear that poverty reduction remains central to Canada's international development assistance efforts, in line with the Official Development Assistance Accountability Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930598">Any economic partnerships supported through official development assistance would be grounded in tangible, measurable improvements to the well-being of communities in partner countries.

              <ParaText id="8930607">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to join the debate on Motion No. 14, and I begin by thanking the member for <Affiliation DbId="317966" Type="2">York South—Weston—Etobicoke</Affiliation> for bringing it forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930608">It appears that the <Affiliation DbId="317966" Type="2">minister</Affiliation> has been listening to those of us on this side of the House, because the motion speaks to three things. First, it speaks about strengthening the accountability and effectiveness of Canada's international development assistance. Second, it speaks about making sure that our international development efforts bring reciprocal economic benefit to Canada. Third, it speaks about making the minister more accountable to this House by requiring an annual report to Parliament not only on the benefits received by other countries, but also on the economic opportunities created for Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930609">Importantly, the focus of this motion is not on the big companies that often benefit from government largesse, but on the workers, innovators, and small and medium-sized businesses that have long been a priority for Conservatives. All of this is a good start.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930610">At a time when so many Canadians are struggling to pay their mortgages, put food on the table and pay their bills, I would have liked to see the government go further. I would have liked a commitment to redirect a portion of the roughly $8.4 billion we spend on foreign aid to be used back home to reduce the deficit and help Canadians with their bills.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930611">However, as I said at the outset, this motion is a good start, a welcomed move in the right direction. I rise today to support it, while offering some constructive suggestions on how we can work across the aisle to restore accountability, results and value for money in Canada's international development work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930612">Canada currently spends about $8.4 billion a year on foreign aid. Of that, roughly $5.5 billion flows through Global Affairs Canada's grants and contributions programs. Earlier this year, the department promised that 86% of that spending would finally be subject to more rigorous checks. I cannot help but ask what happened to the other 14% and the remaining $2.9 billion. I urge the government and the <Affiliation DbId="317966" Type="2">minister</Affiliation> to work toward ensuring that every penny of Canada's foreign aid is properly audited and accounted for. The <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has ordered all departments to rein in spending. When he talks about tightening belts, this is one of the places he should begin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930613">In recent years, Canada's international development programming has become increasingly disconnected from its results. The Auditor General found that Global Affairs was not effectively monitoring its funded projects and, in some cases, did not even have a clear idea of what it wanted to achieve. Too many projects have been overly generous, overly ideological and light on accountability. There have even been reports of funds being misused or diverted to organizations that are sympathetic to terrorism, and I find this to be totally unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930614">What this motion offers is a partial but constructive path forward. Canadians want to know that their tax dollars are making a real difference. They want to know that those tax dollars are saving lives, strengthening economies and building stability both abroad and at home, not disappearing into bureaucracy or ideology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930615">The motion's requirement for new policies to create opportunities for reciprocal economic benefit should allow Canadian expertise and innovation to play a greater role in delivering development goals. When Canadian farmers share their knowledge to improve food security or when educators bring digital learning tools to developing nations in ways that benefit both partners, that is a step in the right direction because teaching and contributing has benefits that we can enjoy back at home. That is how international development should work: projects that lift people out of poverty while also supporting Canadian jobs and Canadian innovation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930616">The motion also proposes a dedicated economic partnerships window “to support projects that align poverty reduction abroad with economic security at home, and that utilize Canadian economic strengths such as clean energy, agriculture, digital technology, and education”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8930617">Right now, those are just words on a page, but I can see how they represent an idea worth exploring, so long as this concept does not lead to yet another layer of Liberal bureaucracy, where yet another friend of the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> ends up with yet another a $600,000 salary. The goal should be efficiency, not expansion, and if the <Affiliation DbId="318709" Type="5">minister</Affiliation> would like help in developing this concept in a lean and efficient way, my door will always be open to him. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930618">The new window should be funded within the existing envelope, not on the backs of taxpayers. lt should focus on clear priorities: Canadian innovation that leads the world; agriculture and agri-tech, where our farmers and researchers have proven expertise; digital technology, which expands access to education and opportunity wherever it finds itself; and skills training, which helps young people abroad build a future for themselves. Each of these concepts connects compassion abroad with economic security and development here at home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930619">The motion also calls for the Minister for International Development to report annually to Parliament. That requirement is essential. Accountability turns spending into trust. When Canadians can see how their tax dollars are used to benefit both Canada and the world and see real results, their confidence grows. Transparency is not an obstacle to compassion; it strengthens it. When Canadians see tangible results, they are proud to give. Under Conservative governments, accountability and effectiveness were not just words; they were principles. Our more limited assistance abroad will show that disciplined, focused aid saves lives and builds global credibility. That same discipline is sorely needed today. lnstead of sprawling programs that lack oversight, we need targeted initiatives with clear objectives and measurable outcomes. Compassion must be matched with competence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930620">As Conservatives, we will continue to scrutinize every dollar the government spends. Canadians are facing record costs, higher taxes and a deepening affordability crisis. They deserve to know that their contributions are used wisely and that their generosity is respected, because generosity must always come with responsibility. Stakeholders in the international development sector understand this. They know that success depends not on the number of announcements made, but on the real difference that programs make in people's lives. From my vantage point, the government makes too many announcements with promises that it does not fulfill. I hope this motion will be different and that it will inspire similar measures across government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930621">This motion does not require new money; it requires a new mindset. lt calls for results, accountability and mutual benefit. lt recognizes that Canada is strongest when we pair compassion with competence, leadership with integrity, and generosity with accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930622">Conservatives will support this motion because it sets a standard the government should already have been meeting. We will watch closely to ensure that this commitment becomes reality. We will also continue to push the government to spend less abroad and more at home during these challenging times, but for now, Motion No. 14 represents a tentative step in the right direction. With the government, I will take it and hope to build on it.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8930623">Mr. Speaker, this is an important issue, especially in these troubled times, these times of crisis, these global hard times. The world is changing in potentially dangerous ways. However, we should not overlook the fact that the global issues of misery, poverty, exploitation and violence have never been completely eradicated at any point in history. Too often, most of the time in fact, they fall through the cracks of public debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930624">There has never been an era of endless prosperity. The grand assurances of the 1990s that globalization would lift the planet out of poverty have not become reality. As we can see today, the promises of a bright future have not actually come to pass. We are still living in one of the darkest and most difficult times, despite everything. Given the rather explosive and challenging global context we are seeing today, it is easy to see and safe to say that we are not where we thought we would be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930625">In his speech earlier, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="317859" Type="2">Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation> mentioned aspects that extend beyond humanitarian assistance. I will come back to humanitarian assistance and to the motion in a moment. We need to keep in mind that a motion is non-binding. It is always better to have one than to have none at all, but it is better still to have an effective policy, an actual law with binding force on governments, especially when our confidence in the government is so low. A while ago, my colleague said that the government funds a number of Canadian mining companies operating abroad that are guilty of exploitation. I would like to talk about that a little.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930626">We heard from representatives of Export Development Canada a few times in committee. They are not entirely sure where the money is going. It is nominally intended to support development and wealth creation, but no one checks whether human rights abuses are being committed over there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930627">While participating in human rights observation missions in Chile and Colombia, I met with populations that had been harmed by Canadian mining companies. Often, these mining companies are not actually Canadian, but they register in Canada because it is extremely easy and because Canada is a flag of convenience. They also register as Canadian companies to benefit from the legal, tax and speculative advantages that come with being listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. I met with people who had suffered due to air and water pollution and people who had been subjected to violence. I myself witnessed a private security system in Colombia stopping people from crossing public land.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930628">Canada is a haven for mining companies, especially since there is no real ombudsperson. The ombudsperson's complaints office cannot compel the production of documents or compel witnesses to appear. This shows that Canada will not be able to restore its reputation in international assistance simply by proposing motions. It should start by cleaning up its own backyard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930629">Let us get back to the motion. As we have said, we support it. We know that the government has been spending for many years. We are not against the idea of spending. We ourselves advocate a certain minimum level of spending on humanitarian aid, but it is important to measure the impact of that spending. Take, for example, the so-called feminist international assistance policy. Of course, we fully support the principle, but there are no checks and balances in place to ensure that the money spent will achieve the goal. We are not the ones saying this; it is the Auditor General.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930630">While international assistance must sometimes be delivered through agencies or organizations like the Red Cross and the World Food Programme, for example, spending on individuals or businesses should be limited in order to avoid waste. We should also look for potential benefits for Quebeckers and Canadians, where possible, and not just economic benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930631">For example, funding for French-language education programs in Africa could help improve the vitality of the French language on that continent. This would also have positive repercussions on the status of French in Quebec, if we are to continue taking in so many immigrants from these areas. This could improve the vitality of French in Quebec and in the rest of Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8930632">This is an example of something we can fund that will benefit people here at home, but it does not mean that it is strictly an economic benefit that can be calculated clearly and spontaneously using indicators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930633">There are also countries like Chile, which, as we know, uses international assistance to advance its economic interests. Sorry, I meant to say “China”. It was a slip of the tongue, although Chile is not one of the most reputable regimes either, and China also has interests in Chile. Anyway, take the example of China and the new silk road. This is a system that has evolved constantly, as we know. It was supposed to be only a few sectors at first, but more and more were added, and it became very digital. The new silk road has really shifted toward technology and digital infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930634">A number of developing countries, including African countries, see this in a positive light. Now, we also know that these countries are receiving crumbs from the west, which also explains China's ideological appeal in Africa. It is extremely appealing to African regimes. However, the conditions attached to the assistance continue to generate strong criticism, and for good reason. I have no qualms about describing these conditions as unfair. China is investing heavily in developing countries. It is building ports and roads, rail lines and infrastructure to secure its own supply of raw materials. When countries are unable to repay their debt, China, the lender, repossesses the infrastructure and resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930635">Ultimately, this allows China to gain the same advantages that large metropolises once derived from their colonies, without necessarily encountering the same disadvantages. It gets to have its cake and eat it too. In addition, China usually imposes a 99-year lease to maintain control over the infrastructure. This is a real problem, and it is something that should be monitored. We have to be wary, because I do not think anyone here is particularly keen on the idea of a new colonialism, like the Canadian neo-colonialism that mining companies are already engaging in. Now it could expanded, if assistance is viewed purely as an economic proposition. Fortunately, I am extremely pleased that the proposed amendment to the motion was accepted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930636">It should also be noted that the Liberals have achieved a remarkable feat: They have done less than Stephen Harper's government in terms of international aid. This was evident when Canada failed miserably to secure a seat on the UN Security Council after its last-minute campaign in 2020, a failure that, according to several experts, can be largely explained by Canada's abandonment of humanitarian aid. We reap what we sow. Canada is very far from reaching its target of investing 0.7% of gross national income in international aid. Instead, it is hovering around 0.3%. In fact, Canada even reduced aid in its 2023 budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930637">When I say we reap what we sow, I think this motion may be the beginning of something, and that is interesting to me. We hope that it will not just be a symbolic motion. Luckily, we were able to put to rest the ridiculous notion of humanitarian aid being justified by purely economic gain. I am happy about that for the reasons I explained earlier. Now, there are so many other things to look at. Let me dispel the notion that Canada is still driven by the lofty ideals of peacekeeping. That is no longer Canada's role. It is no longer the envy of the world. We saw that even during the recent pandemic, when there was a vote at the World Trade Organization to lift patents on vaccines. Canada was among the countries that blocked this, that voted against it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930638">Canada can be a humanitarian country, but it can also be quick to jump into bed with multinationals, depending on where its interests lie. I have already talked about mining companies. I also talked about the idea of having an ombudsman. Canada has a lot of housekeeping to do before it can claim to be a great champion of humanitarian aid.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8930641">Mr. Speaker, it is my honour to rise today on behalf of the good people of Haldimand—Norfolk to speak to a serious crisis in our country. Ten years of irresponsible Liberal crime and justice policies have led to the need for communities across Ontario and across Canada to grapple with growing violence and brazen crime in their neighbourhoods. The consequences of these policies are real. Since 2015, violent crime is up 55%, firearms crime is up 130%, extortion has skyrocketed 330%, sexual assaults are up 76% and homicides are up 29%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930642">When I asked the government to address its record and to commit to reversing laws such as Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, which allowed repeat offenders back on the streets, I referenced the tragic case of 29-year-old Greg Pierzchala. He was a young constable killed by a repeat offender released on bail. The assassination of this young police officer in the line of duty happened in Hagersville, Haldimand County, which is a community that I represent. His loss rattled the community. The outpouring of sadness, the support and the tributes for this young constable at the beginning of his career and of his life were both heartbreaking and deeply moving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930643">Too many families are grieving with unimaginable pain because they lost a loved one to violent crime. The truth is that the same violent offenders are released back into the community, sometimes within hours of their arrest. Because judges are constrained by Liberal laws to impose the least onerous conditions possible, this so-called principle of restraint compels the courts to release at the earliest possible opportunity and impose only reasonably necessary bail standards, even when there is a strong chance of reoffending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930644">Instead of addressing this very real concern of mine, the parliamentary secretary ignored it entirely. When more than half of Canadians no longer feel safe in their own neighbourhoods, my constituents expect seriousness from the government, not non-answers and silence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930645">The uncomfortable truth is that the current Liberal government has undermined safety and justice in Canada by imposing its ideology on the justice system, resulting in preventable deaths. Canadians, including victim advocates, provincial governments and police associations, have long been calling on the government to fix what it broke. Will the Liberals finally adopt our full Conservative plan to end the scourge of violent crime, by passing the Conservative jail not bail act and repealing Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8930646">Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for this opportunity to rise and debate this important issue. I also want to thank my colleague opposite for raising a concern that we actually share: the safety of Canadians and keeping violent repeat offenders off our streets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930647">First, we must recognize the tragic murder of 29-year-old Constable Greg Pierzchala. Our thoughts are with his family, colleagues and the Haldimand—Norfolk community. No family should endure such a loss. Such tragedies remind us that keeping Canadians safe is our solemn duty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930648">It is important to clarify a persistent misunderstanding about former Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>. Contrary to some claims, Bill C-75 did not alter the fundamental law of bail in Canada. What it did was codify key principles already established by the Supreme Court of Canada. The law has always been clear: No one should be released on bail if doing so would compromise public safety or undermine confidence in the administration of justice. That is clearly established under subsection 515(10) of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930649">In fact, the argument presented is self-defeating. The member suggests that repealing former Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> would improve public safety. In reality, repealing Bill C-75 would actually make it easier for some individuals, like those previously convicted of intimate partner violence, to obtain bail. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930650">Let us be clear about the Conservatives' position over the last six months. First, they campaigned on repealing all of Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, including protections for victims of intimate partner violence. When we called them out, they suddenly shifted and said that they only wanted to remove the principle of restraint from former Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, and now their own justice critic publicly states on social media that he is open to amending the principle of restraint. That is three different positions over the last six months. It is hard to take them seriously. They clearly have no plan, no consistency and no idea what they are doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930651">Meanwhile, on this side of the House, the <Affiliation DbId="318625" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> has spent months working in consultation with law enforcement, provincial and territorial partners, constitutional experts and victim advocacy groups building a consensus on how to keep violent offenders off our streets and accountable to the public, and protect individuals and victims. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930652">Canadians want solutions, not slogans. They deserve careful, evidence-based policies grounded in Canadian law and not in imported ideas. What do I mean by “imported ideas”? It is striking to see the types of proposals that the Conservatives continue to push, whether it is the provision of their bail bill, Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document>, the shoot-first policy or a three-strikes law. These measures have all failed in every jurisdiction where they have been tried in the United States. If the Conservatives had been paying attention to the last election they lost, they would know that Canadians want laws made here in Canada, in consultation with provinces and territories, that actually work in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930653">This government is also investing in federal policing, including the hiring of 1,000 new RCMP personnel and expanded resources to combat financial crime, organized criminal networks and online exploitation. These investments reflect a broader strategy, one that combines enforcement with prevention and recognizes that community safety depends not only on strong laws, but also on strong institutions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8930655">The government rejected Conservative proposals to strengthen bail laws and to protect our communities, yet it is now repackaging some of those same ideas as its own, showing that the Liberals care more about political credit than the real accountability for their failures.

The funny thing is that once they realized they did a good thing, they immediately cancelled the programs having positive impacts on Inuit families. While I share this based on feedback from hundred and thousands of families in Nunavut, this will not be enough for the Trump-loving Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930666"> I have data to share. The Qajuqturvik Community Food Centre in Iqaluit collected data during the hamlet food voucher program on what happened when the program was cancelled without consultation or explanation. When the ICFI hamlet food voucher program was running, the number of visits to the Qajuqturvik declined. All of a sudden, the food voucher program was feeding families and bills were being paid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930667">The community of Pangnirtung has similar data. In May 2025, the community reported in its evaluation that during the program, families were able to pay their bills. They reported that families finally had enough support to provide healthy foods. In the community, 95% accessed the program. It is interesting to share that the Northern Store reported an increase of 1.9% in its quarterly reports at the end of July.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930668">When former Liberal minister of northern affairs Dan Vandal kept refusing to answer my questions, I had the indigenous and northern affairs committee agree to study the barriers to providing affordable groceries by bringing in CEOs of Canadian North, Calm Air, the Northern Store and a local co-op from Nunavut. We learned through the study that the CEO of the Northern Store earned millions in income. We also learned that only 76¢ of every dollar went to food subsidies at the Northern Store.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8930671">Mr. Speaker, we do indeed recognize the hardships faced by Inuit and by all residents in Nunavut and indeed across the north, where the cost of food and the cost of basic necessities continue to pose real challenges, particularly for families. In Nunavut alone, 42% of children live in poverty. That is the highest rate in Canada. I know that behind these statistics are real lives and real struggles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930672">Just this past weekend, I had the good fortune to travel to Old Crow, mainly on the theme of the devastating loss of Chinook and chum salmon in the Porcupine River, part of the Yukon River system. In addition to the effect that has on the community's food supply, it also means significant losses over the decades to the culture and the very identity and heritage of the Gwich’in people. There is much work to do there together to restore the salmon to even a fraction of its former abundance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930673"> While there, we also visited the local co-op store and had a chance to see some of the high food prices, even with the northern food subsidy that is applied to a variety of foods there. Everything in Old Crow has to be flown in. This is one more example where addressing food insecurity takes concerted effort and collaboration among indigenous partners, all governments, self-governing first nations and the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930674">Our government is addressing food insecurity in the north through nutrition north Canada, which includes retail subsidies, the harvesters support grant and the community food programs fund, as well as the Inuit child first initiative, which my colleague referred to. Each has a distinct role in supporting food security and family well-being in Inuit communities. Nutrition north Canada's subsidy helps lower the price of food and essential items. Last year, the program's retail subsidy was just under $145 million. It increases by roughly 5% annually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930675">To better meet the needs of northerners, in February 2025, Aluki Kotierk was appointed as the minister's special representative to lead a review of NNC and produce a report. Her report will be really important to inform reforms to the program. To inform the review, retailers, suppliers, local growers, food producers and charitable organizations participating must show how the subsidy reduces costs for consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930676">The harvesters support grant is another way that food security is being addressed. It supports traditional hunting, harvesting and food-sharing activities in isolated communities while reinforcing cultural practices. This is about food autonomy and food security. Wherever I go in the north, the harvesters support grant receives a lot of positive feedback, and I believe that there are many more communities that could benefit from it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930677">There is a lot to describe. I will conclude for now by saying that while progress has been made, we recognize that a lot more needs to be done to address systemic challenges in the north. We remain committed to working with Inuit, territorial and community partners to build lasting and locally driven solutions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8930683">Mr. Speaker, today I rise to talk about the oil and gas industry in Newfoundland and Labrador with regard to our production and specifically our refining.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930684">Newfoundland and Labrador had an oil refinery meeting our province's consumption demands since 1976. There is no doubt it had its ups and downs, but over the years it employed thousands of people including myself, my father, my mother and many friends and family throughout the community. At one point, it was 5% of our province's GDP. There were no royalties from the throughput, but simply income tax revenues and other spinoffs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930685">The refinery used to produce 100% of our island's diesel, propane, jet fuel and gasoline. Then the Liberal government wasted $89 million of federal tax dollars while the province wasted another $17 million on a conversion that converted only to biodiesel fuel. Now we have to ship fuel in from all around the world and everyone is paying the price, literally. Newfoundlanders are paying five cents per litre to accommodate the added cost of storage and shipping from these other countries. The Liberal government refused to build pipelines to bring Alberta oil to the east coast, so instead we are shipping it in from France. We are not even getting Canadian oil. We are not getting Newfoundland oil. We are getting oil refined in France.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930686"> On June 6, a Liberal colleague from Newfoundland proudly announced that the North Atlantic Refining company was expanding. I thought that was exciting. I rejoiced until I found out that it was expanding into France, not Newfoundland, not Canada. While the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was flying around Europe to try to find a good deal, I wonder if he forgot which country he was finding a good deal for. He blames Trump for continuously losing car manufacturing plants to the United States; I wonder what his excuse is for losing refining jobs to France.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930687"> I just cannot wrap my head around how somehow a group of Liberals thought it would be a good idea to spend $100 million to take a refinery that produced 130,000 barrels a day to fuel our province's demands and reduce it to a mere 14,000 barrels a day of only biodiesel that could not even service our gas stations. How on earth could any business produce 10% of the throughput and maintain the same number of workers and the same amount of GDP contribution? How could they not see that this refinery conversion would be on a road to disaster? lt has only been open a little over a year, and they are already announcing that they are on shaky ground, so shaky that they just had to accept another $25 million from the provincial government just to keep the doors open.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930688">When will the Liberal government abolish its green fantasy and actually support oil and gas investments in this country that make sense? Or will it at least get our of the way and steal our common-sense policies to put Canada back on track?</ParaText>

Our collective efforts to advance the biofuel sector are not just about energy; they are about powering our country's economy, strengthening our sovereignty during a time of unjustified tariffs levied by the United States and China, and creating good jobs for Canadians across every region, including in Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930690">Let me begin by reaffirming this government's steadfast belief: biofuels are essential to Canada's environmental leadership and economic strength. They are fundamental to lowering emissions while unlocking new opportunities for innovation and growth. Across the country, including in rural and indigenous communities, biofuels are creating new jobs, reducing our carbon footprint and helping Canada meet ambitious environmental and economic goals.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8930692">Canada is taking bold and decisive action to strengthen our biofuels sector and accelerate investment for the future. We are relaunching and extending the clean fuels fund and stimulating clean fuel production with an additional investment of $776 million from 2025 to 2030.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8930693">Through the Canada Infrastructure Bank, we are committing at least $500 million under green infrastructure to develop, expand, and support biofuel production right here at home.</ParaText>
