Beyond some fantastic beef cattle they raise, John and Maria have been awarded the Canadian Cattle Association's Environmental Stewardship Award for their care of an entire ecosystem that includes more than 1,000 species across 500 north shore acres. These two farmers insist on long-term, intergenerational thinking, and they are providing us proof that when we commit to protecting things for generations to come, we can build things that truly last.</ParaText>

Metcalfe's Garage has successfully operated for the last 125 years and is now proudly the oldest family-owned Ford dealership in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8901786">The journey of Metcalfe's Garage began in 1900 with the vision of Thomas and Clare Metcalfe. The Metcalfes began serving their community by selling the Ford Model T, even teaching people how to drive after they purchased it. Five generations later, Metcalfe's Garage has remained a family-owned company with the same commitment to hard work and service to the community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8901787"> The story of Metcalfe's Garage inspires us all, proving that true success comes from putting the local community first. On behalf of the House of Commons, I want to congratulate the Metcalfe family and their amazing team for 125 years of work and service to our rural region.</ParaText>

Originally from the Eastern Townships, Ms. Bouchard was the first female city manager, the first female municipal councillor and the first female mayor of her town. She made local history with her fierce commitment, her indomitable spirit and her quiet pride.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8901789">Since 1984, she has devoted no less than 40 years of her life to politics. At 84, she is now the oldest mayor in Quebec. Despite her venerable age, she has not lost her spark. During her last term in office, the municipality has been able to acquire unused buildings to lay the foundation for an ambitious project to set up municipal offices, build a community centre and provide accessible housing. Ms. Bouchard's accomplishments command respect. I thank her for everything she has done.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8901811">Long Range Mountains families are working hard to keep food on the table, yet each visit brings shock at the checkout. The price of staples has soared because of the Liberal government's hidden taxes. Those baked-in taxes are clear: the industrial carbon tax on fertilizer and farm equipment, the inflation tax from money-printing deficits, carbon tax two and now the food packaging tax that makes everyday necessities even more expensive. Edward, a senior in the community of Irishtown, told me that he cannot afford a steak dinner even once in a while because it costs him over $50. Canadians are spending $800 more on food this year and local food banks are seeing record demand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8901812">Conservatives offered a simple solution to stop the Liberal taxes on food and they shamefully voted against it. We will keep fighting for Canadians because we know they cannot afford another Liberal broken promise.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8902052">A growing number of taxpaying residents of the Ghost Valley and Waiparous area, including Benchlands, the Summer Village of Waiparous, Ghost Country Place, Pearce Place and households along Richard Road, require access to a functional postal code in order to fully participate in modern daily life. Postal codes are essential for accessing critical services. Residents need them for claims for rural status, filing taxes with the CRA, opening bank accounts, registering children for school, shopping online, requesting supplies for delivery and reporting utility outages. The absence of a functional postal code creates unnecessary barriers for residents and undermines their ability to access basic services that other Canadians take for granted.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8902069">Mr. Speaker, we are resuming the debate from two days ago on a very important bill about a very sensitive subject. We must be serious and rigorous in doing this work, since it concerns misconduct in our armed forces, more specifically, sexual assault. That is why we need to take the time to do things right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902070"> This is an important issue. Every time the army has been faced with an internal problem, it has been able to take control of the situation and deal with it properly. Two days ago, I was talking about some sad events that took place in the 1970s in Loretteville, where I live. Alcoholism was a serious problem for many of our soldiers at the time. People died as a result, and the army took the situation in hand and corrected the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902071"> It was the same thing later on, in the mid-1990s. Sadly, members will recall that the internal traditions of the Canadian Army's paratrooper unit were resulting in inappropriate behaviour. Crimes were also committed when this unit was operating in Somalia. Once again, when the army was faced with an ethical issue, people acted appropriately, and things have improved since then.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902072">From 2015 to 2025, we have been grappling with the issue of sexual misconduct by some of our military personnel. I say from 2015 to 2025 because it is important to remember that, during this period, three reports were produced on the same subject, and the conditions were the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902073">The first report was tabled by retired Supreme Court Justice Deschamps in 2015. It contained 10 recommendations for addressing the scourge of sexual misconduct. Unfortunately, the government that was elected a few months later failed to act for years. Five years later, another investigation was conducted and it reached the same conclusions, namely that the problem had to be addressed. Subsequently, a third report recommended taking action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902074">All of this coincided with the sad episode involving Canada's number one soldier, General Vance, who was facing such accusations. What started as rumours became allegations; testimony was given, a trial was held and a decision was rendered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902075">It was time for the government to take action. We might even say that we wasted 10 years before doing the right thing in this case. Nevertheless, some progress has been made because of all the attention this issue has received. What the government is currently proposing deserves attention, of course. Fundamentally, we agree. That is why we are going to work hard on this bill in committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8902096"> Today, we are talking about Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the military justice system modernization act. This is an issue that I have been following since the beginning of my first term. As the Bloc Québécois critic for the status of women, I have had to take a stand on this issue and study it at not one but two committees, namely the Standing Committee on the Status of Women and the Standing Committee on National Defence, which is why this reform is so important to me. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902097">I will begin with a bit of background. Next, I will address the issue of women in the Canadian Armed Forces and the fact that they are victims of a closed system. I will then talk about the Liberals' inaction and the Conservatives' silence. I will also address the Bloc Québécois's position, and I will close with a few statistics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902098"> Bill C‑11 seeks to modernize the military justice system and remove the military's jurisdiction over sexual offences committed in Canada. This is a direct response to the 2022 Arbour report and the 2021 Fish report, which were released after decades of sexual misconduct scandals in the Canadian Armed Forces. Justice Arbour called out the military's culture of sexism and silence, where women were afraid to come forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902099">The Bloc Québécois will support the principle of Bill C‑11 so that it can be studied in committee, but we denounce the past inaction of Liberal and Conservative governments. We are looking forward to a more in-depth study of this bill because our goal is ultimately to ensure that justice is independent, credible and sensitive to the realities of victims. This topic was the subject of two studies at the Standing Committee on National Defence, where I witnessed Liberal filibustering that was quite striking. At the time, I was replacing my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="317867" Type="2">Pierre-Boucher—Les Patriotes—Verchères</Affiliation>. This situation led to this file being submitted to the Standing Committee on the Status of Women for a study in hopes that the less partisan spirit of this committee would lead to the creation of a report, while everything was at a standstill at the Standing Committee on National Defence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902100">Since the Deschamps report in 2015, all reports have pointed to the same culture of misogyny and impunity. Some have even drawn parallels with the #MeToo movement of victims speaking out. Mr. Vance, Mr. McDonald, Mr. Sajjan and Mr. Trudeau are concrete examples of political leaders failing to bring about real cultural change in the armed forces. Despite the announcements and Operation Honour, victims continued to be betrayed by the chain of command. Ironically, in July 2015, despite the allegations against Vance, he was appointed chief of the defence staff and put in charge of this operation. That is just insane. The Bloc Québécois maintains that no credible reform can be achieved without an independent military justice system. That is the main idea we heard during the two studies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902101">Women in the armed forces have been the victims of a closed system. Jonathan Vance is the symbol of this contradiction: He was leading the fight against sexual misconduct while being accused of it himself. Victims feared repercussions on their careers, and investigations were often biased or hushed up. That is what we heard from witnesses. What is changing with Bill C‑11 is that sexual crimes are being transferred to civilian courts. This is a major step forward. It will end the conflicts of interest, as investigations will be conducted by civilian police. The bill provides for the independent appointment of key military justice actors, such as the provost marshal, the director of military prosecutions, and the director of defence counsel services. It also provides for the introduction of a liaison officer for victims, ensuring more compassionate support. Finally, it ensures that provisions on criminal offences and publication bans align with the Criminal Code. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902102">However, women are still waiting for meaningful culture change, which includes respect, listening and transparency. They want mandatory training for civilian prosecutors on military realities and trauma. They are waiting for stable and predictable funding for victim services. They also want rigorous monitoring of the implementation of the Arbour report.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8902103">Madam Arbour said she was surprised when she was contacted and responded that she thought the work had already been done with the previous report. She finally tabled her own report in May 2022.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902104">I would now like to address the Conservatives' silence and the Liberals' inaction. As I said earlier, the Conservatives appointed Mr. Vance, despite the allegations that had already been made against him. The Liberals were warned by their ombudsman, and they refused to intervene for years. In 2019, they even raised Mr. Vance's salary retroactively to 2018. The government finally took action, but only after pressure from the media and the public, particularly following a Global News article in February 2021.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902105">In the meantime, women saw their careers destroyed, their mental health compromised and their trust broken. I remember the testimony of Stéphanie Raymond, a former CAF master corporal, who was so courageous throughout this whole affair. She appeared before the committee and shared her terrible ordeal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902106">The Bloc Québécois supports the principle of Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C‑11</Document> at second reading. However, the Bloc Québécois is demanding that justice be independent and transparent. We also want a feminist and inclusive approach to implementation, as well as collaboration with Quebec and the provinces and territories in order to align services. This is important. We often say that, while it is good to identify the situation and have a Criminal Code, the implementation of everything that has to do with the justice system is the jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces and territories. This is important to keep in mind. We must fight against sexual violence by listening and being respectful and fair. Quebec and the provinces are responsible for providing appropriate psychological and social support and social services for victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902107">We must also be conscious of intersectional realities. Women, LGBTQ communities, indigenous people and people with disabilities often do not share the same circumstances. At the end of the day, what the Bloc Québécois wants is culture change. There is no other way to tackle an issue as serious as a culture of misogyny and toxic masculinity. The Bloc Québécois called for a complete culture change in sport, and we are doing the same thing now for the armed forces, because women deserve to feel safe in that space.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902108"> I have a number of statistics to share about sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces: 7.5% of women in the regular force were sexually assaulted in 2022, compared to 2.8% of men; 27.3% of women reported being sexually assaulted at least once in their military career; 64% of victims did not report the incident to an authority; 41% said they did not speak up because they feared retaliation, and others were convinced that it would not make any difference. About 86% of assaults occurred in the military workplace. In 2017-18, disciplinary action for sexual harassment was taken in only 20 cases, which is paltry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902109">Intersectional data is also available for LGBTQ+ communities. I would like to mention that some non-heterosexual military members report higher rates of assault and that 67% of members have witnessed discriminatory or sexualized behaviour, often related to gender or sexual identity. The LGBT purge left a dismal legacy: From 1950 to 1990, hundreds of soldiers and police officers were fired for their sexual orientation. I want to thank the members of the Fondation Émergence who came to my office here in Ottawa and filled me in on this sad story. I also want to acknowledge Martine Roy, an activist and former member of the armed forces. She said that the military justice system needs to be improved to make it fair and reliable, to strengthen support for victims, which is essential, and to give civilian authorities the jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute Criminal Code sexual offences committed in Canada. These are all important messages.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8902110">In closing, here are some more important facts: 19% of military personnel were exposed to sexualized or discriminatory behaviour in the previous year, 34% of them being women. The reported rate of assault has increased since 2016, rising from 1.7% to 3.5% in 2022. Only 21% of victims reported the incidents, down from 2018. Sixty-one per cent agree that sexual misconduct remains a major problem. Young people, indigenous women, people with disabilities and LGBTQ members are the most at risk.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8902128">Mr. Speaker, today, it is my turn to address the House, and I do so as the Bloc Québécois critic for veterans affairs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902129">Because of my background in psychosociology, I see victims in a very specific light. The Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs is looking at various issues facing veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. For instance, these men and women may attempt suicide or develop substance abuse problems in response to the trauma they have experienced. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902130">Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document>, which we have been discussing for several days now, deals with a truly important topic. We must address it seriously and with empathy, and honestly, we need to consider the purpose of the bill from an intellectual perspective. As I was saying, we need to address this topic with the dignity and respect it deserves. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902131">That is my hope today as I address all my colleagues. Bill C-11, or the military justice system modernization act, seeks to address gaps and systemic wrongs that directly affect the lives of many women and men.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902132">For the record, I would like to highlight an important article published in April 2014 in L'actualité by Alec Castonguay and Noémi Mercier, which alerted us to cases of sexual misconduct. The article talks about Lise Gauthier, a 51-year-old woman from Sherbrooke who spent half her life in the Canadian Armed Forces. I would like to quote the first paragraph of the article: “Lise Gauthier does not have enough fingers to count the number of times that she was raped, assaulted or sexually harassed by her fellow soldiers.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902133">On March 27, 2015, former justice Marie Deschamps released a scathing report on sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces. This report discusses the existence of a sexist culture, as my colleague the member for <Affiliation DbId="318194" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation> would say. I would like to think that this culture does not exist anymore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902134">The military turned a blind eye to these inappropriate behaviours for many years, starting in the backrooms. I think everyone knows about Jonathan Vance, who has been the subject of much discussion. He had just been appointed the future chief of the defence staff. At the time, the investigations went nowhere. The system was protecting itself. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902135"> In 2018, military ombudsman Gary Walbourne held a private meeting with the then minister of national defence, Mr. Sajjan. Mr. Walbourne tried to discuss a case of sexual misconduct involving Mr. Vance. The victim had decided not to pursue the matter out of fear of retaliation. It was hoped that Mr. Sajjan would intervene to protect the victim, who was Mr. Vance's subordinate. He could have easily derailed her career.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8902136">The crux of the matter is that the chief of the defence staff was at the centre of the military prosecution process. That does not even meet minimum ethical standards. He then became toxic toward anyone who had the misfortune of being in his sights or who spoke out about issues. To be clear, I would call it a military #MeToo.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902137">The then minister of defence, a career soldier, wanted to protect chief of the defence staff, General Vance. What is more, he gave him a $50,000 pay raise. He did not just turn a blind eye. He did worse than that. Let us put ourselves in the victims' shoes for a moment. They must have thought that something did not add up and that things did not make sense. How must they have felt knowing that their attacker was Canada's highest-ranking military officer and that he was untouchable, and then finding out that, on top of that, the minister was going to give him a pay raise? A person cannot be both judge and jury.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902138">I think of all those who have chosen to enlist in the Canadian Armed Forces. We can only commend them for their decision with dignity and respect. Whether they are actively serving, reservists, or even retired from the forces, we owe them respect, and above all, we must protect their dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902139">It is always good to get back to the heart of the matter. Dignity is an intrinsic value of being human. It is what makes people worthy of respect, regardless of their circumstances, actions or social position. With that as our moral foundation, every person must be treated with dignity, never simply as a means to an end. These women and men were not treated with dignity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902140">Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C‑11</Document> aims to close this appalling loophole where man and system are one and the same. Under this bill, the government would select the provost marshal of the Canadian Armed Forces, the director of military prosecutions and the director of defence counsel services. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902141">This would transform the appointment process into a political process instead of leaving it in the hands of military leadership. These individuals would therefore be immune from any form of blackmail. This is what I want to draw my colleagues' attention to. Jonathan Vance, who had sexual relations with a subordinate, allegedly boasted about how the victim could not file a complaint because he had full control over military investigations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902142">As I said at the outset, we are currently studying suicide prevention at the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs. We are talking about the trauma experienced by our veterans. I have one major wish. Now that we are closing this gap, it is essential to respectfully provide these people with all the necessary services and supports. They have serious needs.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8902158">Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise on behalf of the great people of Cowichan—Malahat—Langford on Vancouver Island. I would like to take a minute to recognize a resident from Langford, Mr. Matt Gariepy, who recently retired from the Royal Canadian Navy after 23 years of service. I congratulate Matt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902159">Today I am honoured to speak on behalf of the brave men and women serving our country in the Canadian Armed Forces. As a veteran myself, I am proud to have worked with so many heroic men and women, and I share much respect for those who have served and continue to serve. I understand first-hand the support that all people in uniform need, and I have made it part of my mission to continue to listen and to ensure that their needs are met.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902160">Unfortunately, all too often, people in uniform are impacted by military sexual trauma, an issue that Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> looks to address. My Conservative colleagues and I wholeheartedly believe that we must address and provide realistic solutions to the issues of sexual misconduct, racism, sexism and other forms of harassment in the military. All military members deserve to have a safe and respectful workplace, especially given the amount of sacrifice we already ask of them and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902161">Deschamps, Fish and Arbour are three former Supreme Court justices who have released separate reports dealing with sexual misconduct in the military, the first of which was published in 2015, yet we are still waiting for a majority of the recommendations to be implemented. Less than half of them had been implemented as of the last public updates, and I am at a loss as to why the government has sat on its hands and ignored our military members again and again, especially those who are suffering from military sexual trauma. They deserve better than what the Liberal government has yet to give them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902162">Under the current system, victims and their families have no answers, and their cases continue to sit, awaiting proper action. It is 10 years and three separate reports later, and we are finally seeing the Liberal government start to implement legislation to help deal with the horrific travesties of justice, something the Liberal government should have dealt with years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902163">Though desperately late, Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> has the potential to meet one of the many outstanding recommendations that need to be implemented from the Deschamps, Fish and Arbour reports. The bill is something the Conservatives want sent to committee, where it clearly needs rigorous study. We need to hear from experts, including those in the legal community, and we need to hear from victims and those who have served or are still serving.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902164"> Unfortunately the legislation is not without issue. Conservatives already spoke to numerous stakeholders about the bill when it was in its previous form, Bill <Document DbId="12960457" Type="3">C-66</Document>, and there are many questions and concerns that must be addressed, which is why we support the bill in principle but believe it requires in-depth study at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902165">One of the concerns that has been brought forward is that the legislation would open the door to increased political interference with new Governor in Council appointments of the director of military prosecutions, the director of defence counsel services and the provost marshal. They would be moved from their current reporting structure under the judge advocate general, and while the intention of the change is well-meaning, meant to create independence from the military and the judge advocate general, it would ultimately give more power to the minister of national defence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902166"> Not only would the minister have direct control over the key investigatory and legal positions in the Canadian Armed Forces, but the change would also allow them to issue guidelines related to Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> with respect to prosecutions. While the change would mitigate military interference, it would also open the door to direct political interference. Given the evidence we have seen first-hand of increased political interference from the Liberal government over the last decade, it raises concerns that this pattern may be even worse under the legislation. I am talking about cases like Vice-Admiral Mark Norman and the former chief of the defence staff Jonathan Vance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902167"> Moreover, the logistics around the lengths of the appointments and the process of how individuals would be appointed is unclear. There would be no consistency with the other Governor in Council appointments. We must address these issues before implementing the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902168">The bill indicates that investigations and prosecutions would be moved under civilian authority for sexual misconduct cases that take place within Canada, which we support, but what about the cases that take place abroad while on deployment? Those would still be investigated and prosecuted by the military police, who often already struggle to successfully investigate and prosecute under the current system, and now the concern is that those skills would only atrophy, as they would see fewer cases. This must be considered and accounted for in legislation to ensure that Canadian Armed Forces members can be properly served justice at home or while deployed abroad.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8902169">Additionally, while the military police can still start investigations of these cases on Canadian soil, they are to pass the investigation along to civilian investigators as soon as possible. This is a step in the right direction, but we need to ensure that these investigations are unhindered. This brings us back to the concern over political interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902170">An unhindered civilian investigation will be vital to the success of cases in civilian court, so it is key that the bill outlines that process and includes the importance of unobstructed, independent investigation. There need to be tight protocols for the collection and sharing of information related to the investigations, and there need to be solid protocols for unrestricted access by civilian investigators. These are only a few examples of the key issues that will require rigorous committee examination of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902171">The last concern I wish to speak to today is that of the capacity of the civilian courts to take on these cases. We have seen, over the last 10 years, the civilian courts become more and more overwhelmed because of the Liberals' soft-on-crime policies. The bill would only add to a system that is already over capacity. This may lead to prosecutors' refusing to try a case because of an unlikely probability of conviction. What recourse will this leave victims? Internal service code of discipline punishments may still be possible, but will they happen?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902172">I fear that this will just feed the mentality of excusing systemic military sexual trauma in the Canadian Armed Forces. Our service members do not feel safe or respected. They do not feel supported or honoured by the government. We must deal with the issue of sexual misconduct and harassment so that our forces can begin to feel that respect. Many military sexual trauma survivors are being released or quitting the Armed Forces, along with many others who face systemic issues in the military, which is having a huge impact on recruitment and retention.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902173">We are short approximately 16,500 members in the Canadian Armed Forces. We are desperately short on the hard-working men and women who train up our troops to deploy on missions. Currently, there are over 10,000 undertrained and undeployable members in uniform. That is, over 10,000 men and women do not have the skills or necessary training to perform the jobs they have been hired to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902174">This is both unsustainable and embarrassing for Canada as a nation. We must do everything we can to ensure that the supports our troops actually need and that they are asking for are implemented so that they can feel safe and respected in the workplace, be it on base in Canada or deployed in Latvia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902175">Over the last few days of debate, we have heard a lot about the big names who have been accused of sexual misconduct, such as the admirals and generals who have been charged. Of course, that is what we hear in the news. However, my concern is for the names that do not make the news: the young lieutenant who was repeatedly raped by his commanding officer; the corporal who has gone to her commanders only to be told the evidence is not there, or worse, have the evidence swept under the rug; the young sergeant who was pinned down and raped by her peers because she had received a prestigious award; or the master corporal who was raped by a fellow allied service member in Latvia, outside Canadian jurisdiction and where local authorities are not willing to prosecute. I have heard first-hand as Canadian Forces National Investigation Service members told a victim that they had all the pieces needed to get a solid conviction, but they have been told not to prosecute because it would reflect poorly on the military.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902176">These are all examples of MST victims that I personally know. I have met them, and they have shared their stories with me. These are all examples of what victims are dealing with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902177">This is why we need to move cases to civilian court and why Conservatives generally support Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document>, despite its being 10 years late. We need to make sure these changes are implemented effectively through detailed examination in committee. It is good to see some common agreement in the House on some of the overall goals of the bill. I look forward to resolving these issues in detail in committee so that we can bring the bill back for third reading and see proper legislation in place.</ParaText>

He got quite emotional in that, when we hear these stories and hear how the chain of command did not want to prosecute certain individuals because it might mess up those individuals' chances for career advancement, we can see why the bill is necessary.

              <ParaText id="8902189">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the much-needed modernization of the Canadian military justice system and the transformation of the culture within the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902190">Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> is an important step in renewing the Canadian Armed Forces and ensuring that our military institutions reflect the values of justice and dignity that Canadians and CAF members both expect and deserve. Canada's military justice system must not only reflect fairness, accountability and respect but also uphold the trust Canadians place in the institutions that serve them. Through Bill C-11, we also have a responsibility to protect them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902191">Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> represents change at a time when Canada is making significant investments in the armed forces, but we cannot invest in our military without investing in its people, especially women, victims and survivors of sexual misconduct.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902192">Before my election to the House, I spent my career advancing systemic solutions, equity in political systems and policy reform to strengthen women's representation in public life. I worked to ensure that women and other under-represented groups have a voice in the decisions that affect their lives, particularly in spaces where their voices have traditionally been absent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902193">Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the military justice system modernization act, is in many ways an extension of this work. The legislation is about giving every member of the armed forces the tools, the respect and the support they need to serve in an environment that values their safety and dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902194">The Canadian Armed Forces have a proud and essential role in defending our country and ensuring the safety of all Canadians. Members of our armed forces protect Canada at home and abroad, responding to natural disasters, defending our sovereignty and contributing to international peace and security efforts. Their service across Canada is a source of national pride.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902195">For too long, incidents of sexual misconduct have had deep impacts on individuals, families and entire units. Independent reviews from former Supreme Court justices Arbour and Fish made clear recommendations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902196">Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> would respond to them, ensuring that all Canadian Armed Forces are safe from harassment and from misconduct. The legislation strengthens the system by implementing Justice Morris Fish's call to shift sexual offences to civilian jurisdiction and by building on Louise Arbour's 48 recommendations to address systemic cultural issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902197">First, the bill removes CAF jurisdiction over Criminal Code sexual offences committed in Canada. Civilian authorities would have the exclusive responsibility to investigate and prosecute these offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902198">This is not a technical adjustment. It is a matter of principle. Sexual violence must be addressed with the full transparency, accountability and independence of our civilian legal system. Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> would enshrine in law that CAF would no longer have jurisdiction over such offences. Civilian police forces and authorities would have exclusive jurisdiction, ensuring greater clarity and fairness in how these cases are handled.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902199">These issues are not unique to the military, but they have been compounded by a justice system that, at times, seems ill-equipped to address the complexities of misconduct, especially in a culture with power dynamics that are deeply entrenched. This is why Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> is not only about reforming policies; it is about continuing the cultural transformation inside the CAF. It recognizes that military justice must evolve alongside the needs and values of a changing society. We are committed to ensuring that the Canadian Armed Forces become a place in which every member, regardless of gender, background or rank, feels safe, respected and empowered to serve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902200">Another priority of the legislation is to rebuild public trust in the Canadian Armed Forces, in response to the decades of concerns raised by victims and survivors of the Canadian Armed Forces community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902201">When victims tell us that they have been harmed, we must listen. Our government is taking decisive steps to rebuild and reinforce that trust within the Canadian Armed Forces. The reforms in the bill would strengthen the independence of key roles within the military justice system, including the provost marshal and the director of military prosecutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902202">These roles would be elevated to increase their independence, ensuring that decisions are made based on law and evidence and not on hierarchy or politics. To reinforce transparency, the provost marshal general would be required to submit an annual report to the minister detailing the activities of the military police and the provost marshal. This reporting requirement would reinforce accountability and ensure that Parliament and Canadians are kept informed of progress and challenges within the system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902203">Perhaps most importantly, the bill would enhance support for victims. It would establish the right to request a victim liaison officer, whose aid would be provided to victims throughout the transfer of cases, regardless of jurisdiction. This is a meaningful acknowledgement of the trauma that victims often endure and the need for compassionate, survivor-centred approaches. The bill would help ensure that no matter where a case is handled, the victim is never left to navigate the system alone. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8902204">As we debate Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> today, we must remember that while modernizing the military justice system is important, equally vital is supporting survivors of sexual misconduct.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902205">Over the past decade, the sexual misconduct support and resource centre, or SMSRC, has been an essential part of the defence team's response to sexual misconduct. Through its work, we have been able to provide survivors and those impacted by sexual misconduct the resources they need to begin healing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902206">Let me take a moment to highlight some of the critical programs and services the SMSRC offers to survivors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902207">For anyone who has been affected by sexual misconduct, whether as a victim, a witness or even a supporter of a victim or survivor, the SMSRC provides 24-7 access to confidential, trauma-informed services. For example, the 24-7 support line is available to any member of the defence team or their family, offering anonymous, bilingual counselling and guidance about available options for support, including referrals to community resources. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902208">Additionally, the response and support coordination program assigns a dedicated coordinator to support survivors at every stage of their journey, from initial disclosure through to legal proceedings, even helping survivors transition to civilian services if they choose. These supports are just one part of services for victims and survivors. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902209">Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> goes even further to ensure the justice system within the CAF is truly aligned with Canadian values. One of the most important provisions of the bill is the transfer of jurisdiction over criminal sexual offences to civilian authorities within Canada. This provision aligns with Justice Arbour's recommendation to ensure that such cases are handled by civilian authorities, where they can be investigated, prosecuted and adjudicated independently of the military hierarchy. This move sends a strong message, not just to the survivors but to every member of the Canadian Armed Forces, that sexual misconduct will not be tolerated and will be treated with the seriousness it deserves. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902210">This bill is not just about legal reform; it is also about ensuring that military culture evolves. Culture change is not easy, but it is possible. We have seen progress. We have heard survivors speak out. We have seen a growing recognition that the status quo is no longer acceptable. We must move beyond silence and build a culture of accountability, transparency and respect, not just within the CAF but throughout society on all of these issues. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902211">I want to acknowledge the extraordinary role of gender violence experts such as Julie Lalonde, Farrah Khan, Pamela Cross and Emma Phillips, who have courageously pushed for our institutions to change and invited us all to have a role in changing our understandings of the persistent violence in our communities. This work is especially important as we seek to recruit and retain the next generation of CAF members. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902212">Young Canadians want to join institutions that reflect their values. They want to serve in workplaces that are safe, inclusive and respectful. This bill would help us build exactly that kind of workplace, one where all members can thrive. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8902234">Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to rise in this chamber to put some words on the record about Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document>. This piece of legislation is of national importance. It is well overdue given the time that has elapsed since the recommendations came forward in the initial report, which I believe was commissioned by a Conservative government, on the heinous acts and actions within our Canadian Armed Forces. It is past time that we address these issues in a serious way. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902235">The bill would impact my constituency of Brandon—Souris quite closely. I very proudly represent the hard-working Canadian Armed Forces personnel stationed at Canadian Forces Base Shilo, which includes the Second Battalion Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, the 1RCHA and the many other serving and civilian personnel who operate that base, which has a huge impact. There are over 1,100 employees in total, which is significant in western Manitoba. I am really proud to represent those folks, first as their member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and now here in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902236">From a constituency service perspective, issues around sexual transgressions and sexual assaults within the military come to my constituency office far too frequently, as do the impacts of the lack of services that should be available to many who experience such devastating actions from their colleagues, their spouses or anyone else who chooses to perpetrate such deplorable actions. These are certainly not issues that I am a stranger to, sadly. That is a very unfortunate reality, but it is the reality, so I felt it was important to get up and put a few words on the record in support of the fact that we need to do better by the people who put their lives on the line for this great country under our proud Canadian flag.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902237">It is very important to note that Conservatives have always said that members of the Canadian Armed Forces deserve a safe and respectful workplace and that those who have not experienced that while wearing the uniform deserve justice. We have heard lots of Conservatives raise personal examples, some very personal, of where that has not taken place recently or over the course of many years and, sadly, many decades. It is time to deliver a system that works better for victims and does not protect the bad actors in our system. We have so many systems now in this country that are focused on protecting the wrong people, and victims are left behind. This is just one example, but it is an important one that needs to be addressed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902238">While we certainly support the recommendations and support addressing the system to ensure that there is justice for folks who have experienced this type of trauma within the Canadian Armed Forces, we believe that Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> requires careful study at committee. That is why we are putting words on the record now in debate. The government, which has taken so much time to deliver a bill on this issue, continues to question why the Conservatives are speaking to it. It is because we have important questions that the Liberals need time to answer. We know they are not the most expeditious when it comes to investigating concerns that are raised by Canadians, particularly by the official opposition, and when it comes to the legislation they put forward. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8902239">We are putting them on the record now so that when the bill gets to committee, we sincerely hope, the Liberals may have some answers. I just previously raised a question for a Liberal member who, to her credit, admitted she had no idea what the answer was. I asked why the bill would treat crimes differently on Canadian soil than when our armed forces personnel are deployed. I credit the member for her honesty, but members who are speaking to the bill from the governing party, which put forward the legislation, should likely know the answers to questions before they get up to deliver remarks in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902240">That said, a couple of the concerns we have are about the civilian courts and their capacity to handle the cases. We understand that they may be, and in fact likely are, more experienced in dealing with these types of cases, but the courts are already backlogged. Time and time again, cases of serious violent offences, whether they be sexual in nature or cases of violent behaviour, run up against the Jordan framework, where the perpetrators are getting off on their charges because the courts cannot get through the process fast enough to have cases heard and verdicts delivered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902241">If we would now be adding more cases into the civilian court system, what provisions would the Liberals be putting in place to ensure that the court system could handle the additional workload coming its way? The Liberal government has been silent on that front, which is a concern, because if the Liberals are promising that the cases would be heard in a more effective manner, they need to put the resources behind the bill and streamline the processes to ensure that the cases would not get thrown out because of the Jordan framework.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902242">Why would the legislation cover only domestic cases? I raise that again because it is an important point. The military police would be dealing with fewer cases overall, so that speaks to a potential lack of training or a lack of experience in dealing with cases as time goes on, yet they would still be called upon to do cases overseas. What standards and what training and expertise requirements would the Liberals be putting in place to ensure that the military police keep their standards up and in fact improve them while investigating cases overseas?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902243">This can be challenging at the best of times when there are different jurisdictions and in many cases different nations and citizenships that are involved when such cases take place on multilateral operations, such as the ongoing deployment in Latvia. Soldiers from CFB Shilo in my constituency just completed a six-month stint in Latvia. Where does that leave the military police and their capacity?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902244">Current crime stats are on the rise domestically under the Liberal government; we know that is a fact. We do not anticipate demand going down; in fact it would likely increase for civilian courts if they would be handling military penalties and cases. It could also mean that the Liberals' soft-on-crime policies under Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, where people who commit violent sexual offences are allowed to serve out their sentence on house arrest, may be allowed to do for military cases as well should they all move to the civilian system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902245">On a very small base, like the one in my constituency, there could be people living just down the street from their perpetrator on house arrest while their case goes through the court system and after conviction. We find that completely unacceptable in terms of the scope and impact it would have on the victims, who should be our priority. The Liberals have failed on the domestic civilian front, and we are very concerned they will fail again, as they have been failing, the victims within our Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902246">I think we have raised some significant concerns that the Liberals have failed to provide any reasonable answer for, and that is why it is important that we thoroughly debate the bill, both here at second reading and at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902247">I want to be very clear that we want equal treatment for victims in the Canadian Armed Forces. We need to ensure that there is commonality across the board, and we want to make sure that victims are treated with the respect, the dignity and the justice they deserve.</ParaText>

When harm does occur, they deserve a justice system that is clear and fair and that puts victims and survivors first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902262">For far too long, members of the Canadian Armed Forces, especially women and other under-represented groups, have faced incidents of sexual misconduct and harassment that have shaken confidence in the military justice system. Survivors have told us again and again that the system was not working for them. This is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902263">Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> builds on the brave testimony of survivors and on the tireless work of two former Supreme Court justices, Justice Arbour and Justice Fish, who both studied the issues closely. The bill responds directly to Justice Arbour’s recommendation 5 and to several of Justice Fish’s recommendations to strengthen the military justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902264">The legislation would remove jurisdiction from the armed forces to investigate and prosecute Criminal Code sexual offences committed in Canada. Those cases would now fall under the civilian justice system. This is a major change. Until now, there was what is called concurrent jurisdiction, meaning that both the military and civilian systems could handle such cases. In practice, that created confusion and inconsistency, and too often, victims were left uncertain where to turn.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902265">By making civilian authorities the exclusive jurisdiction for the offences, we would be providing clarity, transparency and fairness. Just as with cases of murder or manslaughter, alleged sexual offences by armed forces members in Canada would be handled in civilian courts. This change ensures that very serious crimes would be treated with the seriousness and independence they deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902266">Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> would also enhance support for victims. It would establish a victim liaison officer, available to victims throughout the transfer of cases regardless of jurisdiction. Victims would no longer be left to navigate two systems on their own. Instead, they would have a designated officer to help them understand the process and have their voice heard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902267">The legislation would also strengthen independence within the military justice system. Key positions such as the director of military prosecutions and the director of defence counsel services would be elevated to Governor in Council appointments. This step would remove real or perceived influence from the chain of command, giving members greater trust in the fairness of the system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902268">Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> would also address historical discrimination faced by under-represented groups in how cases have been processed and transferred. The bill would ensure that the military justice system remains aligned with the Criminal Code and the civilian justice system, creating greater fairness for all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902269">We know this is not happening in isolation. Since 2021, when Justice Arbour issued her interim recommendation, the director of military prosecutions has already ensured that 100% of Criminal Code sexual offence charges are being laid in the civilian justice system. The bill would take the next step by putting the practice into law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902270">Some people may ask why the legislation focuses only on offences committed in Canada. The answer is that this reflects the reality of jurisdiction. For offences occurring abroad, military police would still have to—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8902281">Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize that this bill is not only about legal frameworks but also about cultural change. Our government is committed to building a Canadian Armed Forces that is inclusive, respectful and professional. That is why we are implementing all 48 of Justice Arbour’s recommendations, of which about 20 are already completed, and the rest will be done by the end of 2025. The last recommendation is this bill. If this bill goes through, that will be the last recommendation by Justice Arbour completed. We are also acting on Justice Fish’s recommendations, prioritizing the ones that most improve independence, transparency and fairness. Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> reflects that commitment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902282">I know some will raise concerns about delays in the civilian system or the capacity of civilian police to handle these cases, but let us be clear that these cases are already being investigated and prosecuted by civilian authorities. Our police and courts are the right place for them. Others may point out that the military system could have moved faster to adopt these changes. I agree that change has not come quickly enough, but today, with this bill, we are locking in reforms that could not be rolled back because they would be enshrined in law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902283">Members of the armed forces make sacrifices every day to protect Canada and Canadians. They put service before self. They stand ready to defend us in times of danger. Our responsibility as parliamentarians is to ensure that they serve in an institution that protects them as much as they protect us. This bill is about fairness, about restoring trust and, most importantly, about sending a message to every member of the Canadian Armed Forces, especially every survivor of misconduct. We hear them. We believe them. We are acting to make the system better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902284">Legislation alone will not erase misconduct or rebuild trust. That work requires leadership, training, accountability and a deep cultural shift inside the forces, but laws do matter. They set the framework for justice. They signal what our society values, and they provide the tools for change. Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> is not the end of the journey, but it is a critical milestone. It states clearly that sexual offences do not belong in the military justice system. Victims deserve support, independence and fairness, and the Canadian Armed Forces deserve a justice system worthy of those who serve. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902285">I urge all members of the House, regardless of party, to support this important legislation. Let us get it done.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8902287">He also erred in saying that the sexual misconduct support and resource centre was opening up a section to help victims navigate the legal system in civilian courts because of Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document>.

              <ParaText id="8902308">Mr. Speaker, Canadians have watched over the past few years as the Canadian Armed Forces has made significant efforts to modernize and evolve as a 21st century workplace. While much has been accomplished toward this goal, there is still much more to do. Proposed Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> is another critical step towards meaningful and lasting institutional reform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902309">Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> focuses on strengthening trust and confidence in the military justice system. This would be the next step in the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces' efforts to address recommendations from independent reviews from former Supreme Court justices Fish and Arbour. These reports, and the more than 100 recommendations that stem from them, remain extremely important to our larger cultural change efforts. Overall, these reviews have helped define how DND and the CAF are undertaking changes to the military justice system and cultural evolution efforts. They have allowed for an impartial evaluation process, highlighting both the efforts that have fallen short and the barriers that still exist, and have made recommendations to improve. That is why today I will provide an overview of these independent external reviews and the progress that the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces have made to address their recommendations to date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902310"> I will begin with the independent external comprehensive review, also known as the Arbour report. This review was launched in April 2021 and led by former Supreme Court justice Louise Arbour to examine harassment and sexual misconduct in the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces, as well as policies, procedures, programs, practices and culture, including in the military justice system itself. The final report was made public on May 30, 2022, and the minister at the time welcomed all 48 recommendations. When the final report was received, there were 17 recommendations for which implementation could be undertaken immediately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902311"> This included the implementation of recommendation number 48, appointing an external monitor to oversee the implementation efforts of the Arbour report's recommendations. The minister at the time appointed Madame Jocelyne Therrien as the external monitor who provides monthly progress reports to the minister on the implementation of the recommendations. She also provides biannual progress reports that are made available publicly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902312">The minister also announced the implementation of recommendations 7 and 9, changes to the military grievance and harassment processes, in August 2023. With the implementation of these recommendations, any CAF member who has experienced sexual harassment, sexual misconduct or any other form of discrimination based on sex or gender while performing their duties can now choose to bring their complaint directly to the Canadian Human Rights Commission without first exhausting internal grievance and harassment processes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902313">The Arbour report also outlined improvements for the military college system in recommendations 28 and 29. That is why, in December 2023, the minister announced the seven people appointed to the Canadian Military Colleges Review Board to review Canada's two military colleges. In March 2025, this board released its report, which included 49 recommendations covering a range of areas, including cost, governance and quality of training.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902314"> As we see with Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document>, which is being debated here today, we would also address the key aspects of recommendation 5 of the Arbour report by removing the CAF's investigative and prosecutorial jurisdiction over Criminal Code sexual offences committed in Canada. Since December 2021, all new Criminal Code sexual offence charges are now being laid in the civilian criminal justice system and no new Criminal Code sexual offence charges are being adjudicated in the military justice system. The Canadian Forces military police group is also leading a Criminal Code sexual offences operational framework working group with the Ontario solicitor general and Ministry of the Attorney General to develop a framework for the transfer of cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902315">Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> also addresses several recommendations from Justice Fish's third independent review of the National Defence Act. Bill C-11 would address eight recommendations from this review. These amendments seek to, among other things, first, modify the process for the appointment of the Canadian Forces provost marshal, the director of military prosecutions and the director of defence counsel services; second, expand the class of persons who are eligible to be appointed as a military judge to include non-commissioned members; and third, affirm the judge advocate general's respect for the independent authorities in the military justice system while exercising its superintendence of the administration of military justice.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8902321">The reality is that sex assault victims, whether they be in civilian court or military court, have a complete lack of trust in the system. They call it a system; they do not call it a justice system. There is under-reporting and there are problems with investigations. Some police services believe them; some police services do not. There are difficulties in obtaining additional evidence. There are difficulties with the Crown chosen to prosecute these files. There are issues with the overcrowding in our courts to begin with. We have to apply the Jordan principle. It is no small wonder that in Ontario alone there is an abysmal record of success in prosecuting sex assaults.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8902333">Mr. Speaker, I am honoured today as the member for London—Fanshawe to rise to give a speech on such an important topic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902334">As Conservatives, we honour the brave men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces. Their duty is to protect Canada. Our duty is to protect them. Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> is presented as an effort to do that. It continues the long overdue modernization of the military justice system, and it claims to deliver justice for victims of military sexual misconduct. However, Canadians expect results, not rhetoric. They want to see the bill achieve real progress for victims, for due process and for the discipline and effectiveness of the forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902335">The bill would amend the National Defence Act so that most sexual offences alleged to have occurred in Canada move to the civilian system. It would align military law with recent Criminal Code updates, including publication bans and the Sex Offender Information Registration Act. It would create greater distance between the chain of command and three key justice actors by shifting appointments to the Governor in Council and by having them report directly to the minister. It would rename and rank-inflate the provost marshal to provost marshal general. It would set non-uniform terms for the director of military prosecutions and the director of defence counsel services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902336">On paper, some of this reflects previous expert recommendations made by legal scholars and victims' groups. Conservatives have long said that everyone who serves deserves a safe and respectful workplace free of discrimination, racism, abuse of authority and sexual misconduct.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902337">There is no question that we support the goal of this legislation. Unfortunately, we know that the legislation, in its current form, does not address serious concerns with respect to the capacity, consistency or independence necessary to deliver real justice without creating new problems and inviting political interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902338">Let us start with capacity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902339">Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> does not add a plan to ensure capacity or specialized expertise for military cases entering provincial systems. Since 2021, the government has been sending cases into the civilian stream. Victims and witnesses have waited, and many historical files were never taken up because of stale evidence or flawed investigations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902340">Civilian police and Crown offices are already stretched. The bill does not provide a clear path for historical files. A promise without a plan is not justice. Victims deserve timelines, trauma-informed supports and real prospects of conviction when warranted by evidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902341">My second concern is consistency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902342">The code of service discipline forms a comprehensive framework that upholds discipline, efficiency and morale. It would still apply to almost everything except sexual offences that occur in Canada. Sexual offences outside of Canada would remain under military jurisdiction. Why should the same allegation be treated differently?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902343">This split risks undermining coherence. It weakens the feedback loop between criminal accountability and service discipline for conduct that can be directly tied to military duties and to unit cohesion. Instead, the bill should ensure that findings in civilian court automatically inform service discipline and career consequences. It should also define how the forces would protect complainants on base while civilian processes run their course.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902344">The government needs to explain how military police would maintain their investigative competence if they lose domestic experience in the very file type where expertise matters most. It does not explain how the forces will coordinate with host-nation authorities in deployments at sea or on allied bases where civilians work alongside our members. If we do not plan for this now, we risk weaker investigations and a two-tier outcome for victims depending on geography.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902345">Next is independence and the risk of political interference.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902346">The bill would have key members of the military court system report directly to the minister. Independence from the chain of command is the stated goal, yet the bill would give the minister power to issue written instructions or guidelines in respect of prosecutions. It would vary term lengths in ways that look arbitrary. It would rank-inflate the provost marshal general. It would remove reappointments for two directors but not for others.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8902347">When appointments move to cabinet without clear and uniform safeguards, Canadians see the risk of political interference. They have seen it before. They have seen political interference and a pattern of delay that undermines confidence, leaving victims waiting. If the government wants trust, it should ensure clear, uniform and transparent selection criteria, fixed terms and public disclosure of any ministerial directives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902348">Fairness is also essential. Justice must work for both the complainant and the accused so that outcomes are credible, sustainable and trusted by all. A process that is trauma-informed for victims and procedurally fair for those accused produces stronger convictions and more legitimate acquittals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902349">When prosecutions move to the civilian stream, service members should have clear access to legal assistance so that every case is decided on evidence and law, not on personal means or uncertainty about representation. Ensuring both fairness and consistency is what gives victims true justice and strengthens confidence in the entire system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902350">Finally, in terms of culture and leadership, reports have described a long-standing culture of silence and a pattern of plea deals for minor service offences. That did not magically end with a new bill title. Trust requires leadership accountability. Trust requires that senior ranks cannot use their position to blunt investigations or to steer outcomes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902351">This House must make it clear that nobody is above the law. That includes ministers who ignored evidence, chiefs who were protected and senior officers who allowed plea-downs that erased the seriousness of the conduct. Policy language is not enough; implementation and oversight are everything.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902352">As I said, there is no question that Conservatives support the goal of this bill, but we need to take a responsible approach for this important legislation. We will support moving Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> to committee because victims deserve progress, not more delay. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902353">At committee, we will press for amendments in the following areas, among others: a civilian capacity plan with provinces and territories, including funded training, dedicated contacts for military files, service standards for charging decisions and public reporting on timelines and outcomes; a clear bridge between civilian verdicts and the code of service discipline so that automatic administrative reviews follow criminal findings; real independence safeguards, including uniform non-renewable terms for key directors, transparent merit-based selection criteria and publication of any ministerial directive with reasons; a legal assistance framework for accused members in the civilian stream, with eligibility rules and cost controls so justice is decided on facts, not finances; an overseas investigation plan that sets joint tasking with civilian partners, external reviews of serious cases and clear agreements for ships and allied installations; victim support in practice by expanding the sexual misconduct support and resource centre mandate to provide legal navigation, workplace safety planning and communication with civilian authorities; term and rank discipline that removes unnecessary rank inflation and focuses on capability and accountability rather than titles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902354">This is how we honour the courage of the people who came forward, including those who were ignored or punished for speaking up. This is how we protect current members who still worry about reprisal on small bases or in tight units. This is how we preserve discipline and effectiveness so that the forces can recruit, train and deploy with confidence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902355">Victims want justice that is timely and real. Members want a system that is fair and predictable. Canadians want a military that reflects our values and can meet the threats we face. Conservatives will work in good faith to improve this bill. We will insist on independence with accountability. We will insist on capacity with timelines. We will insist on leadership that takes responsibility rather than hiding behind process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902356">Our men and women in uniform are the best of Canada. They deserve a justice system worthy of their service.</ParaText>

                <I>Uqaqtittiji</I>, I will start by sharing that the NDP supports Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902377">I dedicate this speech to the victims of abuse in the military, who deserve justice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902378">Canadians who serve and have served in the armed forces and reserves deserve our respect and gratitude. Women, men, members of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community, indigenous people and racialized minorities have all served in our military. Too many of them have been subject to sexual assault. Too many have to endure racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia in the course of their service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902379">Members of the Canadian Armed Forces put their lives at risk to defend our sovereignty at home and abroad. They and their families sacrifice so much in order to serve Canada. The NDP is committed to ensuring their health, well-being, safety and protection. We advocate to ensure that they have supports and services while serving and when they leave military service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902380">The Canadian Armed Forces is important for our security and, indeed, our sovereignty. We are all shocked by the news stories of military sexual trauma, and we all want to see meaningful culture change in our military. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902381">I begin by sharing a historical perspective on why we support the bill. In 2015, Justice Deschamps issued her report, with important recommendations. It took the Liberals years to respond. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902382">In 2022, the Liberals accepted recommendations in a separate report by Justice Arbour. The Liberals told Canadians that they would begin transferring all criminal sexual offence investigations to civilian courts. This is another Liberal broken promise. Three years later, approximately half of the cases remain within the military justice system. Why? We do not know.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902383">There were major problems with the cases that were transferred. Retired corporal Arianna Nolet was one of the first military sexual trauma victims to have her case transferred to civilian courts. Unfortunately, her case was stayed because of time delays in the back-and-forth between military and civilian police. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902384">Since this incident, multiple other cases have been stayed because of delays, resulting in a lack of justice for survivors. The causes for the delays were twofold: First, civilian authorities were wary of taking over a case, and because of concurrent jurisdiction, they were not mandated to accept the case. Second, the transfer of case files by the military police was significantly delayed, causing commentators to speculate on whether the military police was unduly stalling the transfer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902385">New Democrats continue to advocate for better outcomes for survivors of military sexual trauma. My friend and colleague, NDP MP Rachel Blaney, was responsible for the landmark parliamentary study on the experience of women veterans. They gave first-hand accounts of the horrific treatments they endured while serving in Canada's military. The study culminated in a powerful report in 2024 entitled “Invisible No More.” This report was the catalyst that finally pushed the Liberal government to act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902386">NDP MP Lindsay Matheson undertook a summer of consultations with survivors and subsequently introduced a private member's bill. Bill <Document DbId="12648794" Type="4">C-362</Document> would have immediately ended concurrent jurisdiction and ensured that no future cases were caught in the tug-of-war over jurisdiction. Unfortunately, Lindsay's bill, Bill C-362, died on the Order Paper when Trudeau prorogued Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902387">Given the state of Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> and the way it was tabled, some questions must be studied at committee. I will name a few. First, the bill does not adequately address incidents in the reserves, the navy, the cadets program or international deployments. Why are they not included? Do they not deserve justice?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8902388">Second, survivors feel betrayed by the federal government. Survivors tell us they need more pathways to justice. They say pathways to justice will be taken away. What consultations included victims, and in what way are their voices included in Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document>?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902389">Third, the bill may have the unintended consequence of creating a binary between criminal behaviour and lesser forms of harassment, which may become more permissive and have fewer supports. What amendments will be needed to ensure victims of any abuse see the justice they deserve?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902390">Fourth, since the sexual misconduct by senior leadership scandal, the NDP calls to make the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces ombuds an officer of Parliament are amplified. This position must have the power to compel documents and conduct systemic investigations. Will other parties support amendments to ensure greater civilian oversight?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902391">Fifth, amendments are needed in terms of the new victim liaison officer. The commanding officer must not be the one to appoint the officer. Given that many cases directly or indirectly involve the commanding officer, we need to find an alternative to this proposal. The appointment must occur outside the chain of command. Further, parliamentarians need to review legal assistance for survivors and the independence of counselling services for members of the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902392">Sixth, the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> warned of an austerity budget. Expanding the mandate of civilian law enforcement without a corresponding increase to their budget will create problems, and, indeed, potentially cost more. The November budget could include cuts to legal services and law enforcement agencies. This makes no sense. Will the budget further cut funding for the military police?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902393">Seventh, given the composition of the Canadian Armed Forces, investigations may include victims, witnesses and others across multiple jurisdictions, and potentially in secure military locations. A local police unit does not have the resources for these cases. It may be logistically difficult to recruit and deploy civilian law enforcement on an ad hoc basis. How will cases be investigated by civilian police when incidents occur across jurisdictions, especially for incidents that may occur during domestic operations, including routine operations in the north and Arctic naval coastal patrols? What about incidents that happen abroad? What tools will civilian courts have in international deployments, navy ships, etc. that cannot immediately be accessed by civilians? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902394">We need to ensure issues such as custody of evidence are considered to avoid having cases thrown out.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8902404">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to debate a bill that is very important for the military community and for Canadians, that is, Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C‑11</Document>, the military justice system modernization act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902405">This bill will have a significant impact on members of the Canadian Armed Forces as well as veterans. Indeed, Bill C‑11 address the concerns that victims and survivors within Canada's military community have shared with us over the past few years. It includes a series of targeted amendments that aim to modernize the military justice system and strengthen support for victims and survivors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902406">The bill responds to recommendation 5 of the report from former Supreme Court justice Louise Arbour and the eight recommendations of the report from former Supreme Court justice Morris Fish. More specifically, the bill proposes to make six amendments. I will give a brief overview of all these amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902407"> First, it will enshrine in law the fact that the Canadian Armed Forces no longer has jurisdiction over Criminal Code sexual offences committed in Canada. Second, it will enshrine in law that civilian authorities have exclusive jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute Criminal Code sexual offences committed in Canada. Third, it establishes a victim's liaison officer, who will be available to victims throughout the transfer of cases, regardless of jurisdiction. Fourth, the bill seeks to strengthen the role of key positions in the justice system to make them more independent. Fifth, it seeks to address the historical discrimination faced by under-represented groups in how cases have been processed and transferred. Finally, the bill ensures that the military justice system remains aligned with the Criminal Code and the civilian justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902408">Our government takes the well-being of Canadian Armed Forces members very seriously. That is why we have worked hard in recent years to implement all 48 recommendations from former Justice Louise Arbour's report. More than 30 of those recommendations have already been implemented. By the end of the year, with the passage of this bill, I hope we will be able to say that not just 47 recommendations, but all 48 recommendations made by former Justice Arbour have been implemented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902409">I would like to provide an overview of Justice Arbour's recommendations. Three years ago now, Justice Arbour submitted her final report on sexual misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces to the Minister of National Defence. This report, entitled “Report of the Independent External Comprehensive Review of the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces”, contains 48 recommendations that focused on reforming the “institutional shortcomings and structural impediments” that allowed the problem to persist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902410">In recommendation 48 of her report, Justice Arbour called for the Minister of National Defence to appoint an external monitor to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the report and other external recommendations that she accepts. The external monitor, Jocelyne Therrien, shared her fifth report in July. Ms. Therrien emphasized that we are making progress and are on track to meet the intent of the 48 recommendations by the end of 2025.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8902411">Indeed, in our efforts to follow up on recommendations 1 and 2, we have made significant progress in clarifying definitions and terminology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902412"> In June of last year, the defence team announced that policies using the term “sexual misconduct” would be updated to replace it with “harassment of a sexual nature”, “conduct deficiencies of a sexual nature” and “crimes of a sexual nature”. In addition, “sexual assault” will be separately defined in the relevant policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902413"> In March of this year, CAF adopted the Canada Labour Code definitions of harassment and violence, aligning its harassment and violence prevention program with the public service workplace harassment and violence prevention program. This resulted in a unified workplace harassment and violence prevention policy that applies to both National Defence public service employees and members of the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902414"> This change also addressed recommendation 3 of Justice Louise Arbour's report. Members of the Canadian Armed Forces who experience or witness harassment or violence in the workplace now have a simplified incident reporting system, informal resolution mechanisms and a simplified investigation process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902415">We have also made progress in providing a range of relevant services and supports to victims. In response to recommendation 14 of Justice Arbour's report, the sexual misconduct support and resource centre has expanded its services to include a full-time legal resource responsible for providing information and assistance to victims of sexual misconduct in a military context. The next step will involve providing access to civilian lawyers able to contribute their assistance in different parts of the country at no cost to victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902416">Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C‑11</Document> takes another step forward by improving support for victims and assigning exclusive jurisdiction to civilian authorities for investigating and prosecuting Criminal Code sexual offences committed in Canada. Our government remains steadfast in its ongoing commitment to addressing all forms of misconduct and unprofessional behaviour within the Canadian Armed Forces. It is imperative to ensure that victims and survivors receive the support and justice they deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902417">In conclusion, Canadian Armed Forces members are always there to ensure Canada's security and it is our duty to protect them from harassment and misconduct. The 48 recommendations made by former Supreme Court justice Louise Arbour clearly showed us the path to follow to change the culture of our institution, and the external auditor, Jocelyne Therrien, is ensuring that we respect this commitment, this new path.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902418">In closing, I want to thank the members of the Canadian Armed Forces and the veterans for their service to Canada. I hope that all my colleagues in the House will support this bill so that we can ensure justice for victims of harassment and sexual misconduct.</ParaText>

One of the first things to do is assure victims of sexual harassment or misbehaviour that the system is not stacked against them. The way to do that, as we saw in the report by Madam Justice Arbour, is to take them out of the system where they could be seeking justice from their superiors or where those working on a file could be trying to pursue a case against a military superior. That does not lend confidence to the system, so it is important for victims to have an independent system, which is what they would be guaranteed by criminal courts outside of the military service. That is the first step, and it is one step that would go a long way to changing the culture in the military.</ParaText>

Now the Liberals want Canadians to trust them with this new legislation. How can the Liberals be trusted to enact justice reforms to protect members of the Canadian Armed Forces against sexual misconduct, given their record of allowing sexual predators to serve their sentences at home?</ParaText>

First of all, this legislation reflects directly the recommendations by former Supreme Court justices Louise Arbour and Morris Fish. Second, the member can take confidence in the fact that the person responsible for making sure the recommendations are being followed going forward, Madame Jocelyne Therrien, is following through on them. She can assure parliamentarians and, most importantly, members of our Canadian Armed Forces that these recommendations are being followed through on.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8902430">Mr. Speaker, today we are talking about Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document>, the military justice system modernization act. The effect of the bill would be to remove the military court's jurisdiction to try offences of a sexual nature and move them to civilian courts, which would have exclusive jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902431">Our proud Canadian Armed Forces has a deep-seated problem that the bill aims to tackle. This is not new information; it is something we have known about for a long time. Let me read what Justice Marie Deschamps said in her report 10 years ago, which was commissioned by the Conservative government at the time. It is a report on sexual misconduct and sexual harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces. She found “a disjunction...between the high professional standards established by the CAF’s policies on inappropriate sexual conduct...and the reality [on the other hand] experienced by many members day-to-day.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902432">In other words, everything looked good on paper, but in reality not so much; it was quite a different story. The judge heard from many witnesses and summarized some of the evidence in her report. That was 10 years ago. Here we are in 2025, finally acting on it. The Conservative Party has always supported all the recommendations of the Deschamps report, and it is a shame they have just not yet all been implemented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902433">Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> is before us now. Before I get into the details of the bill, the good, the bad and where improvements are required, I want to shed a positive light on our proud Canadian Armed Forces. We can be proud of our men and women in uniform. I want to share some examples of their great success stories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902434">In Operation Reassurance, Canada was serving as the framework nation for NATO's multinational battle group in Latvia, a key part of NATO's enhanced forward presence to deter aggression in eastern Europe. That is more important now than ever. Operation Unifier was Canada's military training mission supporting the armed forces in Ukraine. That is also very important at the moment. Of course, we also have Canada's participation in NORAD, the binational military partnership between Canada and the United States, still our best friend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902435">In all these missions, the Canadian Armed Forces has distinguished itself with high professional standards and effective performance and has gained the respect of our NATO partners. All of this has happened despite the fact that the Liberal government for the last 10 years has underfunded the Canadian Armed Forces and not met our NATO commitments. Our NATO partners are counting on us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902436">I want to take a moment to highlight some of the work that is being done in my local Conservative association, the group of volunteers at home that keeps me grounded and connected to my community. It also includes my advisers; they are currently working on a policy statement that they are hoping will advance all the way to the Conservative Party convention scheduled in Calgary for early next year. It is about funding the Canadian Armed Forces to meet our NATO requirements. I want to thank my team back home for working on this very important issue. I want to give a big shout-out to the current president, Reese Yearwood, and the past president, Wout Brouwer, both of whom have been working diligently on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902437">I will now go back to Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document>. It is an enactment in response to two reports. I talked about the Deschamps report. There is also the Fish report of Mr. Justice Fish, from April 2021, which offers a sweeping critique of and reform road map for Canada's military justice system. The second report is by Louise Arbour from a year later, 2022. It delivers a scathing assessment of how the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces handle sexual misconduct and institutional accountability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902438">I will read a couple of quotes from each of the reports, because I think they are important. They are both very extensive reports. I did not read the whole of the reports, but I read big sections. I highlighted a couple of paragraphs to quote.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8902469">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand with the brave military personnel who have suffered from sexual misconduct within our Canadian Armed Forces. Their courage in coming forward has exposed systemic failures that have persisted for far too long, and these failures demand our unwavering attention and action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902470">Let me be clear from the very onset that Conservatives unequivocally support victims of sexual misconduct. We believe they deserve justice, transparency and a workplace free from harassment, discrimination and abuse of power. This is not a partisan issue; it is about honouring the service of the people in uniform and ensuring their safety and dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902471">However, while victims deserve justice, they have been let down time and again, not just by individuals but by the very government charged with protecting them. The Liberal government has had a full decade to address the issues but has repeatedly failed Canadians and members of our armed forces. We must ask, why should Canadians, especially those in uniform, trust the government? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902472">We saw one glaring example when the former minister of national defence, Harjit Sajjan, was complicit in covering up the sexual misconduct allegations against the former chief of the defence staff, General Jonathan Vance. When Sajjan was presented with evidence, he refused to accept it. Not only that, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was also complicit in the cover-up for three long years. These were years of silence and inaction while victims waited for justice. Let us remember that the Justice Deschamps report commissioned under the previous Conservative government was delivered in 2015, with clear recommendations to tackle sexual misconduct, yet the Liberals sat on the report, leaving it to gather dust while the problems festered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902473">Fast-forward to years later, and what do we see? The government finally brings forward Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document>, but only after a decade of delaying and only when political cover became necessary. The bill, while containing some positive changes, raises more questions than it answers and introduces concerns about political interference that could further harm victims and service members alike.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902474">National defence is not just about tanks, planes and ships; it is also about people, brave men and women, who put on the uniform every day to protect our country. They deserve respect and protection. We must invest not only in their equipment and training but also in creating a military culture free from harassment and misconduct. How can we expect a culture of accountability and readiness when the government continues to neglect funding, equipping and modernizing our military?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902475">I will remind the House that the Royal Canadian Navy is operating decades-old warships well past their prime. Our Royal Canadian Air Force flies 40-year-old CF-18s that are past their operational life span, while the government has dithered with their replacement. The Canadian Army lacks basic resources, from personal protective equipment to modern artillery. There have been reports of soldiers buying their own equipment, and training has been cancelled due to budget cuts. Meanwhile, Canada remains well below NATO's 2% defence spending target.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902476"> As far as recruitment goes, the Canadian Armed Forces is facing a shortfall of 16,000 personnel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902477">The first responsibility of the federal government is the protection of Canada and those who serve us. We face a rapidly changing global threat environment, from Russia's invasion of Ukraine to the instability in the Middle East and growing tensions in the Indo-Pacific. Our military must be strong, prepared and respected, and this includes having a justice system that is fair and trusted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902478"> Conservatives fully support transferring jurisdiction of most sexual offences committed in Canada from the military justice system to civilian authorities, as has been recommended by the respected Deschamps, Arbour and Fish reports.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8902479">Unfortunately, this is not the reality. Our civilian courts are under-resourced and overwhelmed. Court delays are rampant, and victims of sexual assault often see their cases dismissed or delayed under the Jordan principle, which forces charges to be stayed if trials are not held in a reasonable time frame. This means adding further trauma and uncertainty to survivors. According to testimony heard at the status of women committee, only a tiny fraction of reported sexual assault cases ever lead to convictions. Even then, penalties are minimal. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902480">Victims deserve justice free of political gamesmanship, and the accused deserve a fair and impartial process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902481">Let me remind the House about the handling of Jonathan Vance's case. Despite credible allegations, the government gave Vance a raise while investigating his wrongdoing. It was a clear signal to victims that their suffering was secondary to political expediency. Moreover, the defence committee, which should have been a forum for accountability, was suspended for months amid Liberal filibustering, preventing proper oversight and investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902482">The government's pattern of delay, of denial, of shielding high-ranking officials and of stalling justice cannot be ignored. We have heart-wrenching testimony from survivors describing gang rape, sexual violations and the pervasive culture of silence within the military. They have waited years for reforms that have only just now been proposed. Bill <Document DbId="13608745" Type="3">C-11</Document> may be a step forward, but it is long overdue and still incomplete.

              <ParaText id="8902487">Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege to rise in this House once again and ask the government a question that it has not been all that forthright in answering: What, precisely, are its plans when it comes to its long-standing desire to censor what Canadians see, say and do on the Internet?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902488">Not that long ago in this House, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="318663" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Identity</Affiliation> what he was planning to do. Actually, I asked him if he would cop to the fact that he was the minister tasked with online censorship, given that there seemed to be some doubt and some examples of Liberal ministers clamouring over precisely who got to take up that honour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902489">I need to give a bit of a history lesson for those who have not been following this. For the last two Parliaments, the Liberals have tried to bring in draconian online censorship bills. They tried it in the 43rd Parliament and failed; they tried it in the 44th Parliament and failed. Now, both the <Affiliation DbId="318625" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="318663" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Identity</Affiliation> have said that this still remains a very live priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902490">When it comes to online censorship, the Liberals are saying, “If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.” What Canadians are saying is to take the loss and sit down. Canadians do not want the government to regulate online speech; they do not trust the government to do it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902491">We are already seeing with Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> that the Liberals reduced the threshold of what constitutes hate speech. We have seen them, in that bill, water down a definition that has been working in criminal law in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902492">Bill <Document DbId="12913297" Type="3">C-63</Document> in the most recent Parliament, the online harms act, went far beyond this. Bill C-63 would empower the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to prosecute Canadians for saying things that offended people online. The Liberals were bringing back a much maligned and, I am grateful to say, formerly repealed section of the Canadian Human Rights Act, section 13. That is what is at issue when we talk about so-called “online harms.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902493">I have no doubt that tonight the parliamentary secretary to the minister will talk about all the examples of why this is so necessary, but the reality is that condemnation of the Liberal government's online harms proposals has come from left and right. It has come from civil liberties groups on the left and right, and it has come from Canadian luminaries such as Margaret Atwood, who I do not believe would ever align herself with those of us on this side of the bench, because Canadian free speech advocates, Canadian artists, scholars and journalists all realize the importance of being able to speak one's mind without the government weaponizing a definition of hate to censor what Canadians do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902494">I bring this up now because when I asked the <Affiliation DbId="318663" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> the first time around, he started talking about Google trying to give money to pacify the government when it comes to local journalism initiatives. The minister was mixing up the many online censorship bills the Liberal government has put forward. I realize there have been a lot of them; it is tough to keep on top of them. I was not asking him about Bill <Document DbId="11528728" Type="3">C-11</Document>, which forced the government to mandate YouTube algorithms and streaming. I was not talking about Bill <Document DbId="11668222" Type="3">C-18</Document>, which the government used to ultimately pull local news and all journalism off the Facebook and Instagram platforms in Canada. I was talking specifically about online harms, a term that the government uses to cloak what it is doing in something that may make someone who does not pay attention to these issues feel that it is a good thing. In reality, it has no other objective but to reduce what is acceptable and permissible in the bounds of debate and free society. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902495">I am asking the government, once and for all, will it commit to taking its so-called online harms censorship bill out of the playbook and not censor what Canadians say and do online?</ParaText>

We know that social media platforms are being used to threaten, intimidate, bully and harass people. They are being used to promote racist, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, misogynist and homophobic views that target communities, put people's safety at risk and undermine Canada's social cohesion and our democracy. Social media platforms are also used by predators and offenders to exploit children. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902505">Conservatives like to pretend that any attempt at addressing online harms is an affront to freedom, yet we know for a fact that four in 10 Canadians are exposed to online hate on a monthly or weekly basis.

              <ParaText id="8902517">Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives try to spread misinformation, but the reality is very different. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902518">First, Canadian Blood Services manages Canada's blood supply, outside Quebec, independently and at arm's length from the federal government. Héma-Québec operates the same way within Quebec. Both work with the provinces and territories; in turn, they determine how plasma is collected in their jurisdictions, including the role of paid plasma collection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902519">Health Canada is involved in only the regulation of the safety of blood plasma collection and products made from blood and plasma. It has no role in the day-to-day operations of Canadian Blood Services, no matter what the Conservatives insinuate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902520">Second, as the Conservatives are all very well aware, Canadian Blood Services has stated time and again that it does not sell the blood or plasma it collects from Canadians. For the Conservatives to imply otherwise will only spread misinformation and fear at a time when our provincial and territorial partners are working hard to increase their blood and plasma supplies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902521">Lastly, Canadian Blood Services has made it very clear that it is selling a waste by-product called albumin to Grifols. Canadian Blood Services has stated publicly and repeatedly that Canada already has sufficient albumin for the needs of Canadians and is therefore allowing Grifols to sell excess albumin.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902522">What this means for Canadians is that Grifols takes albumin, sends it to a manufacturing facility outside Canada and turns it into life-saving plasma. Again, it is a waste by-product. Canadian Blood Services then buys it back at a significantly reduced rate, increasing the Canadian blood supply. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902523">In fact, because of agreements such as this one, Grifols is opening the very first manufacturing facility in Canada for plasma products, in Saint-Laurent, Montreal. That will establish Canada's very first end-to-end domestic blood supply chain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902524">To state this clearly: Canadian Blood Services is not selling Canadian blood overseas. It is working to increase our blood supply. Selling off excess waste products has no impact on Canada's blood supply. Canadians can rest assured that if they have donated plasma to Canadian Blood Services or Héma-Québec, it is being used exclusively to make products for Canadians, and these products are not being sold abroad.</ParaText>

When Bill <Document DbId="13547622" Type="3">C-5</Document> was pushed through Parliament, thousands of indigenous people had been and remained evacuated from forest fires. While indigenous people coped with losing their livelihoods, the Liberals violated their rights to give free, prior and informed consent to Bill <Document DbId="13547622" Type="3">C-5</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902531">The Liberals' goal of building Canada strong oppresses indigenous nations. Building Canada strong keeps indigenous people in poverty. It keeps indigenous people without infrastructure like housing, infrastructure to provide safe drinking water and infrastructure to generate economies based on indigenous strength.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902532">In 2021, Canada adopted UNDRIP, which committed Canada to taking the necessary measures to ensure Canadian laws are consistent with UNDRIP. On free, prior and informed consent, it states that UNDRIP will provide all peoples with the right to “freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902533">The Liberals see FPIC as a barrier to economic goals. Their investments in natural resource development manipulate indigenous communities into economic development disguised as economic reconciliation. There is no reconciliation in taking land and resources from indigenous people without consent. </ParaText>

This council brings together 11 exceptional representatives from first nations, Inuit, Métis and modern treaty and self-governing communities from across the country. The council's expert advice shapes policy and improves operational practices, guaranteeing that indigenous perspectives and interests are truly embedded in major project decision-making. This is not just an advisory role in name only; its contributions will have tangible impacts on project design, execution and outcome, reflecting our dedication to nation-to-nation, government-to-government and Inuit-Crown relationships grounded in respect and recognition of rights, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8902539">We know that reconciliation and economic transformation go hand in hand with the inclusion of indigenous peoples.

Initially launched as a $5-billion initiative, this program now dedicates $10 billion to supporting indigenous peoples' participation in capital, not only in energy and natural resource projects, but also in infrastructure, transportation and trade projects. This program addresses persistent barriers to financing and encourages indigenous communities to participate in major projects, thereby opening new avenues to prosperity.</ParaText>

The Major Projects Office has made significant financial commitments totalling $40 million over two years to strengthen indigenous peoples' ability to participate in major projects. From the earliest stages of project development, these targeted investments help participants hone technical skills, deploy clean technologies and support indigenous communities in their energy transition and sustainable resource development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902541">Advancing reconciliation is not only the right thing to do, it is also essential to Canada's long-term economic growth and environmental stewardship. Our success depends on building strong, respectful relationships with indigenous peoples, who are the original stewards of this land. We are therefore taking bold and historic steps to ensure that indigenous peoples have access to capital and are truly part of the prosperity that these projects generate.</ParaText>

                <I>Uqaqtittiji</I>, it is clear that the Liberals have no concern for indigenous peoples and their rights. Their so-called consultations were nothing more than a publicity stunt to limit backlash. The Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Assembly of First Nations and Métis nations expressed their concerns regarding Bill <Document DbId="13547622" Type="3">C-5</Document>. However, it was still rushed through to become law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902543">At the same time, the Liberal government is projecting cuts to Indigenous Services Canada. Making cuts to Indigenous Services Canada programs and services would mean losing investments in indigenous peoples' well-being and support. How will the Liberal government support indigenous peoples' well-being?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8902544">Mr. Speaker, the hon. member will appreciate a few examples of indigenous-owned and partly owned projects that our government helped fund. Let us start in Saskatchewan with the Bekevar Wind energy project. This is one of Canada's largest wind farms. The Cowessess First Nation is a majority owner, and it is backed by $50 million in federal support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902545">There is also the Oneida Energy Storage project. A leading example of large-scale battery storage, this facility is a partnership that includes the Six Nations of the Grand River Development Corporation, Northland Power, NRStor and Aecon Group. It stands out as one of the largest indigenous-partner energy storage facilities in North America. It received $15 million from the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8902546">There are many more examples I can speak to, but let me be clear that we are committed to reconciliation, to duty to consult and to supporting indigenous equity and leadership—</ParaText>
