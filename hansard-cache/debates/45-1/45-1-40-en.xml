              <ParaText id="8924547">He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House to introduce this important bill. Employment insurance has been in need of a major reform for years. The Liberals promised to reform the system but then did nothing. This bill seeks to correct two completely unacceptable situations that are easy to fix.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924548">When someone comes back from maternity leave and loses their job, they are not eligible for employment insurance benefits because their qualifying period is too short. This bill will remedy this ridiculous situation that mainly affects women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924549">This bill will also correct another situation. People who are eligible for EI sickness benefits are entitled to up to 26 weeks, while family caregivers, who are often women, are entitled to only 15 weeks. It is completely ridiculous that the person helping the sick person does not have access to the same number of weeks of benefits as the sick person.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924554">The legislation addresses a long-standing injustice in Canada's airline industry: the widespread practice of having flight attendants do unpaid work. Canadian flight attendants are currently expected to perform a range of essential duties without compensation when the aircraft is not in motion. This is unacceptable and must end. No one in Canada should be expected to work without pay. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924555">The bill would require airlines to compensate flight attendants for all hours worked, including pre-flight, postflight and training time. It is about ensuring fairness and recognizing the critical role flight attendants play in keeping our vital air transport system moving and passengers safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924556">I urge all members to support the bill and end unpaid work in the airline industry once and for all.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924559">In contrast, the United States has seized millions of U.S. dollars' worth of goods arriving from a single region of origin. One thing cannot be denied: The Canadian model is a failure. The Liberal government must be aware of this, since it committed to tabling a similar bill before the end of the year in the 2023 and 2024 budgets, and yet it did not do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924560">I am therefore pleased to table this bill today, which will emulate the U.S. model in that the importer will bear the burden of proving that goods originating from certain entities were not produced using forced labour. That is what is in effect in the United States, and this system is working very well. We do not want our goods to be tainted with blood.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924562">The people of Swan River are experiencing an alarming increase in violent crime that has threatened the safety and well-being of families across our region.

              <ParaText id="8924564">Petitioners in the Swan River Valley want to see an end to the Liberals' reckless catch-and-release policies so that criminals stay behind bars. This is why the people of Swan River are demanding jail, not bail for repeat violent offenders.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924567">The petitioners note that brain injuries can occur in many ways, from accidents to illnesses and strokes, and they often result in serious physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioural effects. They further point out that brain injuries are frequently linked with other challenges, including substance use and homelessness, creating additional barriers for those affected. It is estimated that 1.6 million Canadians are living with a brain injury today, yet there is no coordinated national response. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924568">The petitioners therefore call upon the Government of Canada to develop a national strategy on brain injuries to improve awareness and prevention, as well as to ensure better access to treatment, rehabilitation and recovery supports for Canadians living with the impacts of brain injury.</ParaText>

That is, in fact, octopus and squid farming. The animals are bred in captivity, slaughtered for human consumption.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924570">Canada currently has no legislation to regulate or govern this emerging potential industry, and certainly, in the wild, cephalopods are solitary, wild animals that are ill-suited to be raised in captivity and recognized as sentient beings. Therefore, the petitioners ask that the Government of Canada act in response to this threat, ban the importation of farmed cephalopod products and prohibit the breeding and raising of cephalopods in captivity in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924583">Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by acknowledging that we are gathered today on the traditional and unceded territory of the Algonquin and Anishinabe people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924584">I am pleased to rise in the chamber to speak about the ways we can and must improve Canada's asylum system through the legislative amendments proposed in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924585">Canada's immigration system has long been a source of pride and a key driver of economic growth. As global migration patterns evolve due to conflicts and crises, the government is committed to restoring balance and trust by building a more flexible and responsive system that safely manages the flow of people entering the country. The bill is an important and timely opportunity to address the mounting challenges Canada faces at our borders. I will go through some of these challenges and how the legislative changes in the bill would guide us toward a more secure and productive future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924586">The first challenge facing many countries is the sharp rise in the number of people seeking asylum. Millions of people continue to flee conflict, persecution and instability, driving one of the most significant global migration shifts in modern history. Migration patterns are also evolving as people move across borders and oceans in search of safety and opportunity. Canada continues to be a destination of choice for those looking to build a better future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924587">In 2022, Canada processed over 91,000 asylum claims. That number rose to over 143,000 in 2023 and to over 171,000 in 2024, nearly doubling in just two years. Our system has been strained by this increase. It has caused lengthy processing time and backlogs, as well as prolonged uncertainty for claimants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924588">The bill puts forward amendments to improve the efficiency of asylum claim processing so that claimants would receive the fast, fair and final decisions they deserve. The proposed changes touch multiple parts of the process, from initial entry to timelines for decisions and follow-up actions. The focus is on the streamlining of operations while maintaining fairness and security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924589">To start with, the bill proposes using a single online application for all claims. Right now, applications can be different depending on where the claim is made, whether that is at an airport, a land border office or an immigration office in Canada. A single online application would allow information to be shared more easily across Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada; the Canada Border Services Agency; and the decision-making body, the Immigration and Refugee Board. The change would make the process more efficient for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924590">Next, we propose to enhance due diligence and reduce backlogs by making sure a claim is hearing-ready before it is referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board to schedule a hearing. Ensuring that only hearing-ready files are referred to the board would allow cases to be scheduled more confidently, reducing the need to postpone or follow up on incomplete files. The change would also strengthen program integrity by minimizing the back and forth between organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924591">We also propose to improve the system by making it easier for the Immigration and Refugee Board to remove incomplete or unresponsive claims from caseload inventories. According to the bill, the board's refugee protection division would have the authority to determine that an application has been abandoned when a claimant fails to comply with certain requirements. It already has the authority to deem an asylum claim abandoned after it has been referred to it. It would now also be able to deem the claim abandoned if the requirements are not met before referral, such as in the case of submitting an incomplete application or failing to respond to requests.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8924592">Claimants would still have the opportunity to explain why their claim should not be abandoned. The right would be enshrined in the legislation. Similarly, we propose to give the minister the authority to determine that a claim is withdrawn, following the request by a claimant or their representative. Today, it needs to be referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board for a separate withdrawal process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924593">To assist with faster decision-making, we propose to officially transfer scheduling authority to the Immigration and Refugee Board. We would also mandate that in-Canada asylum claims can be adjudicated by the board only while the claimant is physically present in Canada. Likewise, admissibility hearings could also be held only while a person is here in Canada. These changes would help protect against fraud, reduce the need for postponements and maximize the availability of resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924594">The bill next addresses how to mitigate sudden increases in asylum claims and reduce pressure on the asylum system, while deterring those who may look to misuse the system. Canada's asylum system is already under significant strain, and we need to protect against potential future surges and alleviate the backlog. The new provisions would provide protection for those in need, while discouraging claims from people seeking to use the asylum system to get around immigration rules or to extend their temporary stay in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924595">That starts with creating an ineligibility rule for the claims that are not made within a reasonable timeline. The legislative changes would make claims made more than a year after the claimant first arrives in Canada ineligible to be referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board. This measure would apply to anyone who entered the country after June 24, 2020, including people in Canada on a work or study permit. It is meant to discourage misuse of the asylum system by those seeking a shortcut around regular immigration processes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924596">There are several practical reasons for the amendment. The one-year time limit was chosen because a significant majority of people make a claim within their first year of being in Canada. The use of a one-year period is also a clear and easily communicated timeline for asylum seekers to understand the period in which their claim may be found eligible. The amendment would capture the claims of anyone who entered Canada after June 24, 2020, and it would apply whether the person has current valid status or has renewed their status, whether their status has expired or whether they were issued a new permit because the one-year starting point for the eligibility will be their first entry into Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924597">While irregular border crossings have dropped significantly since the Safe Third Country Agreement was expanded in 2023, we still want to make a targeted legislative amendment. Under this change, foreign nationals who cross irregularly into Canada from the U.S. and make an asylum claim after 14 days would no longer have their claim referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924598">Crossing into Canada between official border crossings is illegal and dangerous. We always urge people to use safe, regular pathways to enter our country, and always at ports of entry. People whose claims are found ineligible under the new rules would be able to apply for a pre-removal risk assessment to ensure that they are not being returned to a country or a situation where they would face persecution or serious harm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924599">A third challenge Canada needs to be better equipped to face is another major world event like the COVID-19 pandemic. When that started, people put their travel plans on hold, but Canada's inventory of applications continued to grow. The current laws allow us to act in certain cases with individual documents, but not on a large scale in response to wide-ranging emergencies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924600">We do not have the ability to cancel, suspend or change large numbers of immigration documents, which limits our management and response to unpredictable scenarios when needed. The legislation would allow the government to act on a large scale for immigration documents, like temporary resident visas, eTAs and permits. The government could also pause acceptance of new applications and suspend or cancel applications in our inventory when it is in the public interest to do so. Giving Canada more control over its immigration documents would allow us to respond to exceptional events in ways that protect Canadians and our public resources.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8924601">A well-managed and efficient asylum system does more than uphold our international obligations; it ensures protection for the world's most vulnerable people while helping Canada maintain stability and compassion in an increasingly unpredictable world. The government is committed to strengthening Canadians' trust in the integrity of our immigration system. We do that by making sure our system remains fair and compassionate for those who are seeking our protection, while being effective, orderly and reliable for the country as a whole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924602">The measures in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would help reinforce program integrity, speed up processing and offer greater clarity and certainty to people fleeing conflict and persecution when they need it most. We would be strengthening the system to reflect these realities and to prepare for the challenges of tomorrow.</ParaText>

I think it is worthy of note that, whether it is with respect to the asylum issues in 2012 or those today, there is a time when we need to look at ways we can improve upon the system, and that is exactly what the legislation would do. It recognizes the need for change because of things that have taken place. Whether with respect to the pandemic or the wave of international students, there are some serious issues. By passing the legislation, we would be reforming the system.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924636">Mr. Speaker, it is always an honour to rise on behalf of the amazing folks of the riding of Essex. I will be sharing my time this morning with the member for <Affiliation DbId="317749" Type="2">Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924637"> I do not get a lot of opportunities to speak in the House because we have so many more Conservative members, but every time I do get a chance to speak, I always want to give all praise, honour and glory to our Lord and Saviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924638">I would like to begin by expressing my sincere gratitude to the dedicated men and women of the Canada Border Services Agency. These officers are the front line of our national security. Their work is demanding, and their commitment is unwavering. For all they do, they deserve clear policies, proper resources and respect, not vague directives and unchecked government powers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924639">As the member of Parliament for Essex, I represent a riding that sits at the heart of one of Canada's most vital economic corridors, the Detroit-Windsor border. In Essex, we understand the importance of secure borders. We live it every day. We also understand the opportunities and the challenges that come with living next to the border. That is why I stand today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924640">This legislation claims that it would enhance border enforcement and streamline immigration processes, but as someone who represents a border community, I must ask this: Would this bill truly serve the interests of Canadians, especially those of us living at the border? In its current form, the answer is no.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924641">Conservatives have long called for improvements to border security and our broken immigration system. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> may be a starting point, but it requires significant amendments. It must include clearer definitions of ministerial powers and ensure that exporters are not burdened with added compliance costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924642"> We know that economic prosperity and responsible immigration go hand in hand. When one system fails, the other suffers. That is why we support efforts to modernize enforcement and crack down on organized crime, fentanyl trafficking and immigration fraud. These are real threats, and we are glad the government has recognized them, but we must be vigilant in how these reforms are implemented.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924643">Let us be honest. The immigration system did not break itself. It was broken by years of Liberal mismanagement. The backlog of applications, the lack of transparency and the inconsistent enforcement all stem from a government that has failed to plan, failed to listen and failed to act. Now, with Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the Liberals are scrambling to fix the very system they dismantled, but instead of thoughtful reform, they are reaching for sweeping powers and vague regulations. That is not leadership; it is damage control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924644">We must acknowledge that this bill has serious shortcomings that must be addressed before it is allowed to impact the lives of Canadians. Conservatives believe in strong borders. We believe not only in protecting Canadians from illegal activity, trafficking and threats to public safety, but also in accountability, transparency and respect for individual rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924645"> My office regularly hears from constituents about the real-world impacts of federal decisions, such as delays at the Ambassador Bridge, astronomical fees on exports and frustrations with immigration and enforcement. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would grant sweeping new powers to the government, which would only add to these frustrations, with limited parliamentary oversight. That should concern every Canadian, especially those of us in border communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924646">It is deeply ironic that the Liberals show little concern about violent repeat offenders who remain in Canada after receiving lighter sentences than their crimes deserve, yet they seek the power to cancel or suspend valid visas of permanent residents who have followed due process and contribute meaningfully to our country. The bill also fails to outline how new regulations would be enforced. This raises a troubling question: Is this legislation simply a way for the government to claim it is fixing the immigration system it broke without taking real action?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924647"> Conservatives believe in responsible immigration that prioritizes economic needs and family reunification. We support measures that streamline processing, reduce backlogs and help newcomers integrate successfully, but we oppose policies that put power in the hands of ministers without proper oversight. Furthermore, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> contains provisions that could unintentionally harm Canadian exporters. There are implications of increased processing times, additional expenses and vague inspection requirements that could disrupt trade and burden businesses.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8924648">The people of Essex, and all Canadians, cannot afford to suffer the consequences of Liberal missteps, and the bill would impose further financial responsibilities on exporters by requiring them to upgrade their facilities to comply with the new CBSA inspection regulations. That is an unfair and unnecessary burden, especially during a time of financial uncertainty when every dollar matters, both for businesses and for individual Canadians, and especially when considering the Statistics Canada Q3 report for this year, which found that, following tariff announcements, exports to the U.S. dropped 15.7% and imports fell 10.8%. This clearly shows that businesses are facing mounting costs, increased input prices and uncertainty due to shifting border policies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924649">We cannot add to the pressures faced by Canadian businesses with more unclear border directives. Consider our greenhouse growers, who rely on timely border crossings to deliver fresh produce to markets in Michigan and Ohio. Any delay, whether due to increased inspections, unclear regulations or bureaucratic bottlenecks can mean lost revenue, spoiled goods and broken contracts. Our auto parts manufacturers, which are part of a tightly integrated supply chain with Detroit's automotive industry, depend on predictable and efficient border operations. More frequent inspections could slow down export processing across all sectors, not just for the high-risk goods the bill aims to target. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924650">The new requirements for inspection facilities and associated delays could also increase warehousing costs, with the greatest impact falling on small and medium-sized exporters, 35% of which reported to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business in May of this year that they already experience border delays, with the average time spent at border crossings being up to two hours. These are real consequences for real people. If Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> introduces new compliance burdens or slows down processing, it could further jeopardize jobs and investment in our region at a time when hard-working Canadians are already struggling to provide for their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924651"> Conservatives agree that Canada's borders must be safe and secure, but we must also protect the economic backbone of our country: our exporters, our manufacturers and logistics providers. This is something our government should already know. A report from the Standing Committee on International Trade during the 44th Parliament identified regulatory complexity and inefficiencies at the border as major barriers to Canadian exporters. The report even recommended that inspection protocols should be streamlined to avoid further harming trade. That is why the bill needs amendments to prevent unintended harm to Canadian businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924652">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> also touches on information sharing and surveillance powers. It is important to introduce tools that help law enforcement do their jobs, but we must be cautious about infringing on privacy rights. Canadians deserve to know how their data is being used, who has it and what safeguards are in place. Transparency must be a cornerstone of any security policy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924653">Conservatives have a clear vision for border security and immigration. We support investing in border infrastructure to reduce wait times and improve efficiency. We advocate for strong partnerships with our U.S. counterparts, especially in regions like Windsor-Detroit, where co-operation is essential. We believe in empowering local law enforcement and border officers with the tools and training they need, not just more paperwork. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924654"> That is why I urge the House to scrutinize the bill carefully, consult with stakeholders in border ridings like Essex and make the necessary amendments. Let us hear from our farmers, our truckers, our customs officers and our local mayors to ensure this legislation reflects the realities on the ground, not just the theories in Ottawa.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924670">I hope all colleagues in this chamber had an amazing Thanksgiving. I enjoyed the week in my riding, but I am back in Ottawa to continue the important work we do here on behalf of Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924671">We are debating this bill today because this is the Liberals' second attempt in the same Parliament. Their first attempt would have allowed for a massive, sweeping violation of every law-abiding Canadian's individual freedom and privacy. In fact, that bill, which has not been withdrawn, as we found out from a Liberal member this morning, and is still on the Order Paper, would allow Canada Post to open any mail, including letters, without a warrant. It would ban cash payments and donations over $10,000. It would allow for warrantless access to personal information. It could compel electronic service providers to re-engineer their platforms to help CSIS and the police access information, and it would allow the government to supply financial institutions with Canadians' personal information, apparently in an attempt to resolve money laundering and terrorist financing. These are Canadians' hard-earned rights that the Liberal government seems to not want to respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924672">The Liberals tried to pass a power grab to access Canadians' personal information from service providers like banks and telecom companies without needing a warrant, and worse, they did not consult the Privacy Commissioner. It was only due to Conservative pressure that the Liberals backed down, it appears, with the introduction of Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>. The Conservatives will always stand up for Canadians' individual freedoms and privacy. They are fundamental tenets of a democratic nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924673">This new bill continues with the same old Liberal soft-on-crime policies that are causing crime and chaos in our communities. Liberal bail is still very much alive and well for those who traffic guns across our border and terrorize our communities. There are still no mandatory prison times for fentanyl traffickers. Astonishingly, there are still no mandatory prison times for gangsters who use guns to commit crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924674">In the last month alone in one of the municipalities in my riding, Richmond Hill, we saw two brutal executions in broad daylight on quiet residential streets, one of them with a firearm. The Liberals have let thousands of guns flood across our border that are used to commit crimes in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924675">I think members of the Liberal government need to rethink the way they are trying to fool Canadians. Everything is not a political issue. The decisions we make in this House affect real people. In making the announcement the Liberals made on December 5, 2024, as they do every year the day before the anniversary of the Polytechnique massacre, to say they were banning firearms, they tried to capitalize on that anniversary for political gain. That does not resolve the problem, I say to my fellow colleagues across the aisle. Illegal guns are coming across the border. It is not law-abiding Canadian citizens, hunters or sport shooters who perpetrate these crimes. It is not people with licensed firearms who commit these crimes. People who commit these crimes purchase guns from the back of a car, the back of a Honda, at the mall or in some aisle somewhere, for $600 or $700. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924676">The Liberals are not serious about resolving the issue, and in Richmond Hill, in the last 30 days, there were two murders in broad daylight, one with an illegal gun that came across the border, which the Liberal announcements every year in the early part of December have not been able to resolve and will continue not to resolve. Instead of taking real action and implementing real consequences for those smuggling guns at our borders, the Liberals want to waste millions of dollars buying back guns from highly vetted legal firearms owners. This would do nothing and has done nothing to reduce crime in our communities.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8924677">Criminals are laughing at the Canadian government. When they get arrested by our hard-working law enforcement officers, under this bill, they would still be let out on bail, sometimes hours later, as we are told by police forces across the country. They would then go out and brutalize our communities over and over again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924678">When criminals are convicted, Liberal hug-a-thug policies allow many of these criminals to serve their sentences from the comfort of their own home. Wow. What a big penalty. We need jail, not Liberal bail for violent offenders, and only Conservatives will bring safe streets back to our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924679">This bill also touches upon immigration and, more specifically, our asylum system. Let me be clear. Over the last 10 years, the Liberal government has systematically dismantled our immigration system and obliterated our asylum system. Back in the days of Prime Minister Harper, when I had the honour of serving as the parliamentary secretary to the minister of citizenship and immigration, our asylum system was well respected around the world and operated with swiftness, integrity and fairness. In 2014, there were fewer than 10,000 asylum claims pending. Today, there are hundreds of thousands, due to the Liberals' failed policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924680"> Why has the government, for years, put asylum seekers, including many who make false claims, in hotels at taxpayers' expense? Canadians right across our country would love to hear the answer to that question. Why has the Liberal government, for years, given asylum seekers a more generous health care plan than the one Canadians receive? Numerous constituents in my riding would love the level of coverage given to asylum seekers. How is this fair to Canadian taxpayers and the Canadian people? This is billions of dollars allocated away from other services and infrastructure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924681">It is unacceptable that the Liberals, by their inaction and rhetoric, facilitated the flow of asylum seekers coming to Canada through other G7 countries. I would argue, as many people would, that the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany are safe, peaceful and democratic countries with functioning asylum systems. When individuals enter Canada through a G7 country, it makes a mockery of our system and undermines our commitment to processing genuine refugees efficiently. These are people who need help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924682">Canada's once well-perceived, respected and functional immigration system has been ruined by 10 years of abysmal Liberal policy. Millions upon millions of immigrants arrived through all channels without the proper health care, housing or jobs to support them. The Liberals' bringing in millions of new immigrants with not enough jobs available means that youth unemployment is at a staggering high. The Liberals' bringing in millions of new immigrants without the necessary health care capacity means that costs go up and wait times get longer. The Liberals' bringing in millions of new immigrants without the proper housing drives up housing costs, making housing unaffordable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924683">Both Canadians and immigrants suffer due to these policies. We cannot blame immigrants for the Liberals' failures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924684"> Functionally, our system has lost most, if not all, of its integrity. There is very little enforcement of departures and very little tracking of individuals in the system, and the asylum claim backlog is mountainous. Furthermore, the reports of individuals with serious criminal convictions being let into the country under the government's watch represent a threat to public safety and raise questions about the thoroughness of all background checks being completed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924685">In closing, the seventh <Affiliation DbId="318691" Type="4">immigration minister</Affiliation> in 10 years has offered no solutions. This bill would continue to clog up our immigration system and push the problems down the road. Luckily, Conservatives will end this chaos, fix our once proud immigration system, add more CBSA officers, end and reform the temporary foreign worker program and build an immigration system that Canadians can be proud of once again.</ParaText>

I am proud to support this legislation, which would help keep Canadians safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924700">There is no greater priority for our government than keeping our communities safe and our economy thriving. Our economy cannot thrive if we do not take strong measures to combat crime and ensure that our border is safe and secure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924701"> We live in a time of evolving global threats. Transnational criminal organizations, rising auto theft networks and the flow of illegal drugs continue to devastate families and our communities. We also face new migration pressures driven by conflict, climate change and economic instability. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would respond to these realities with a balanced approach. It would equip our law enforcement agencies with modern tools to protect Canadians, while safeguarding their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924703">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is built around two pillars. These are securing our borders and combatting organized crime, illegal fentanyl and illicit financing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924704">Under the first pillar, amendments to the Customs Act would empower the CBSA to examine and detain goods leaving Canada. This new authority would help officers intercept stolen vehicles, firearms and narcotics before they leave our ports. Across Canada, and especially in urban regions, auto theft is fuelling transnational organized crime. Criminals are exploiting export loopholes and shipping stolen cars overseas. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would close those gaps and give the CBSA the tools to act firmly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924705">The bill would also amend the Oceans Act to grant the Canadian Coast Guard a security mandate. This would allow the Coast Guard to patrol our coastal waters, collect and share intelligence and work hand in hand with the RCMP and CBSA. For the first time, our maritime borders would be integrated into our broader national security strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924706"> Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would further enable the RCMP to share information on registered sex offenders with domestic and international partners, strengthening community safety and aligning Canada with its allies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924707">Within our immigration system, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would make important reforms to ensure fairness and integrity. It would streamline asylum claim processing, prevent misuse and strengthen information sharing with the provinces and territories. The new measures would help manage sudden surges in claims while ensuring that those genuinely in need of protection continue to receive it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924708">I want to be clear that there would be no ban on asylum claims. People found ineligible under specific circumstances would still have access to a pre-removal risk assessment to ensure that they are not returned to danger. This strikes the right balance between compassion and credibility.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8924709">The second pillar of Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> directly targets organized crime and the illegal drug trade. Amending the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act would allow the government to rapidly control new precursor chemicals used in the production of drugs such as fentanyl. This flexibility would allow law enforcement agencies to act faster and prevent dangerous substances from entering our communities. In my home province of British Columbia, the opioid crisis has taken a devastating toll. Stopping the supply of illegal fentanyl before it reaches our streets is a crucial step in saving lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924710">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> also strengthens Canada’s defences against money laundering and terrorist financing through amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act. It increases penalties for financial crimes and adds the director of FINTRAC to the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee to improve oversight and collaboration. By cutting off the flow of dirty money, we would make it harder for organized crime to thrive. These measures would make a tangible difference in people’s lives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924711">Since the start of this year, the CBSA has seized more than 2.7 million grams of cocaine, 2,500 grams of fentanyl, 662 firearms and nearly $30 million in currency. This results in lives being saved and communities being protected. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924712">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is the product of listening to law enforcement, provincial partners and Canadians who want a government that is both compassionate and firm. We listened to the concerns of stakeholders and colleagues in the House on Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>. That is why we have introduced Bill C-12, which is tailored specifically to border security and combatting transnational organized crime, illegal fentanyl and illicit financing to ensure the safety of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924713">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> does not cover bail reform, but the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced this past Thursday that our government will soon be tabling legislation to introduce amendments to the Criminal Code regarding reverse-onus bail for major crimes. This bill shows Canadians that their government is serious about security, serious about fairness and serious about protecting the values that define us. It modernizes our systems, respects privacy protections and ensures that our law enforcement and security agencies have the authority they need without compromising the rights of individuals. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924714">In Surrey Newton and communities throughout the country, these issues are deeply felt. Residents want to know that stolen vehicles are not disappearing across the border. Parents want their children to be safe from fentanyl. Newcomers want to see a system that is efficient, fair and worthy of their trust. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> delivers on all those priorities. A secure Canada is a strong Canada. This legislation keeps Canadians safe, reinforces public confidence and ensures that Canada remains a place where opportunity and safety go hand in hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924715"> I urge all members of Parliament to support this bill. Together, let us strengthen our borders, protect our communities and build a safer, more secure future for all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924730">Mr. Speaker, today the House is debating important legislation: Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the strengthening Canada's immigration system and borders act. Bill C-12 would strengthen our country's security by proposing changes to support border security and immigration, to fight transnational organized crime and to disrupt illicit financing. We urgently need to update many of our laws if we want to be able to address the complex security challenges our country is currently facing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924731">With Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, CBSA officers would have the capacity to inspect exported goods in warehouses and transportation hubs. Owners and operators of certain ports of entry and exit would be required to provide facilities for export inspections just as they currently do for imports. These changes would strengthen the CBSA's ability to detect and seize contraband for export, including illicit goods such as fentanyl and stolen vehicles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924732">Canada's coasts also face new security risks. That is why this bill would allow the Canadian Coast Guard to conduct security patrols. It would also be able to collect, analyze and share information for security purposes. Canada strictly controls synthetic drugs and the precursor chemicals used to produce them. Unfortunately, the illicit drug market is constantly evolving in an attempt to evade these controls. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would ensure the Minister of Health can rapidly control the precursor chemicals used to produce illicit drugs, including fentanyl.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924733">Border security and immigration are top priorities for the Liberal government. Notably, this bill would also help us enhance the integrity and fairness of our immigration system. Canada's asylum system exists to protect people who are fleeing persecution or risks to their life or safety in their home country. The strengthening Canada's immigration system and borders act would, among other things, improve how we receive, process and decide on asylum claims to make the system faster and easier to navigate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924734">The amendments contained in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would also help law enforcement respond more effectively to evolving border security challenges. Border security requires a coordinated effort across the entire government, as information from various federal institutions may be required to thoroughly assess the situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924735">Federal departments and agencies need to work together to share information in order to understand and respond to demands and to keep people safe. For that reason, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would enhance the ability of the RCMP to share information on registered sex offenders with domestic and international partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924736">It would improve how IRCC shares information so that federal, provincial and territorial partners can make timely, accurate decisions to ensure the integrity and better delivery of public services. IRCC already shares applicant information with its domestic partners in limited circumstances, but this bill would create clear and direct legal authorities to allow for proactive and systematic information sharing and to reduce administrative burdens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924737">Any new use or disclosure of personal information under these new authorities would follow existing privacy laws, policies and best practices. Additionally, the proposed measures would strengthen Canada's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regime, including through stronger anti-money laundering penalties. It is well known that money laundering supports crimes like human trafficking, fentanyl trafficking, fraud, theft and other economic crimes.

              <ParaText id="8924738">The measures contained in the bill would strengthen businesses' compliance to anti-money laundering obligations, including through a 40-times increase in administrative penalties.

              <ParaText id="8924740"> Because international organized crime networks represent the biggest threat to our country's security, we have already taken several important measures. First, our government established the integrated money laundering intelligence partnership with Canada's largest banks, which is enhancing our capacity to develop and use financial intelligence to combat fentanyl trafficking and other organized crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924741">Second, we have listed seven transnational organized crime groups as terrorist entities under the Criminal Code. Listing is an important tool that supports criminal investigations and strengthens the RCMP's ability to prevent and disrupt criminal activities. We continue to monitor this and will add more to the list as needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924742">Finally, Canada appointed its first fentanyl czar, who serves as the main interlocutor between the Canadian and U.S. governments for enhancing our collaboration in combatting fentanyl. While less than 1% of illicit fentanyl seized in the U.S. is linked to Canada, we are working to ensure fewer drugs and their precursor chemicals cross our shared border. To increase our illegal fentanyl detection abilities, we are training and deploying new border detector dog teams that specialize in fentanyl detection.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924765">Conservatives have forced the Liberals to back down from Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>. That bill would have given the government broad powers to access Canadians' personal information from banks, telecoms and other service providers without a warrant. The Privacy Commissioner confirmed that the Liberals did not consult him before proposing these sweeping powers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924766">Law-abiding Canadians should not lose their freedoms because of the Liberals' overreach. Now the Liberals have introduced Bill C-12. Conservatives will examine the legislation carefully. We need to ensure that it does not infringe on Canadians' privacy rights. We will hold the government accountable to protect individual freedoms and ensure transparency in how it exercises its power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924767">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is a broad omnibus bill. It includes changes to border security, crime prevention, privacy laws and immigration. For example, it amends the Customs Act to allow the CBSA to use facilities free of charge for enforcement. That is good for the budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924768">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> also amends the Oceans Act. It enables the Canadian Coast Guard to conduct security patrols and share information with law enforcement and intelligence partners. It increases penalties for money-laundering violations and expands FINTRAC's authority. That is laudable. However, it also allows for more information sharing between government departments, raising serious concerns about privacy protections. We will not allow the Liberals to quietly erode Canadians' rights in the name of administrative efficiency. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924769">Some of the most troubling parts of Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> have been removed, such as part 4, which allowed Canada Post to open any mail, including letters, without a warrant, as well as part 11, which banned cash payments and donations over $10,000. Those were egregious overreaches. It was due to pressure from the Conservatives that, thankfully, those parts were removed. However, my Conservative colleagues and I believe this still falls short on many issues facing everyday Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924770"> For example, crime is rising across Canada. Since 2015, violent crime has increased by 37% in my home province of Alberta. Nationally, homicides are up nearly 28%. Gang-related homicides have risen 78%. Firearms-related violent offences have more than doubled, rising 116%. Extortion is up a whopping 400% in Alberta, and sexual assaults have increased by 75%. These are alarming trends. The Liberals' soft-on-crime policies are making our communities less safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924771">Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, passed in 2019, introduced a principle of restraint on the granting of bail and prioritized early release for offenders in lieu of public safety. This has led to catch-and-release practices for serious criminals, including those trafficking fentanyl and firearms. Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document>, passed in 2022, repealed mandatory prison sentences for crimes involving firearms and reinstated house arrest for serious offences, such as sexual assault, kidnapping and human trafficking. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924772">These changes send the wrong message to Canadians and put people at risk. Conservatives proposed Bill <Document DbId="12269389" Type="4">C-325</Document> to reverse those changes and strengthen sentencing. The Liberals and the NDP voted against it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924773">While Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> does well in filling in an important loophole by banning precursors of fentanyl, it fails to address sentencing for fentanyl dealers. Tougher penalties for traffickers and producers are essential if we are serious about stopping the spread of this and other deadly drugs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924774">The fentanyl crisis demands urgent action. From January 2016 to June 2024, over 49,000 Canadians died from apparent opioid toxicity. Nearly 80% of those deaths involved fentanyl. Emergency visits for fentanyl poisoning have more than doubled since 2018. This is unacceptable. Earlier this year, the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> downplayed the opioid crisis during a campaign stop in Kelowna, calling it only a “challenge”. That is deeply offensive to the families of the more than 49,000 Canadians who have died from overdoses in under 10 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924775">We are seeing the impact in communities across the country. Just this week, in Medicine Hat, police and ALERT carried out a major drug bust, seizing 598 grams of fentanyl, as well as other illicit drugs and cash. That amount of fentanyl alone represents nearly 300,000 fatal doses.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8924776">Across Canada, fentanyl superlabs are producing massive quantities of this deadly drug, and police in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec have seized tens of kilograms of fentanyl and thousands of kilograms of precursor chemicals. These operations often include stockpiles of weapons and explosives and pose a serious threat to public safety, yet the government's response still falls short. Without tougher sentences and stronger enforcement, fentanyl will continue to devastate families and communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924777">The Liberals have also refused to back down from supporting safe consumption sites near schools. My Conservative colleague from <Affiliation DbId="317739" Type="2">Riding Mountain</Affiliation> called on the government to shut down these sites near children. The <Affiliation DbId="318692" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> suggested more might be approved, even after admitting that these locations often become hot spots for fentanyl use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924778">Law-abiding Canadians deserve better. They deserve strong protections for privacy and freedom. They deserve laws that keep our communities safe and hold criminals accountable. They deserve a government that takes the drug crisis seriously, not one that shrugs it off as a mere challenge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924779">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> also touches on immigration and asylum, areas where Canadians' compassion has been abused by the government. Canadians are generous and fair-minded, but that must never be taken for granted or exploited.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924780">The Liberals have exploited Canadians for the past decade on this matter. A decade ago, Canada's asylum system was in control. The backlog accounted for fewer than 10,000 cases. Today, that number has exploded into the hundreds of thousands, and many of these claims are bogus. This is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924781">Let me be clear that it is wrong to jump the line. It is unfair to take advantage of a system that was built to protect people fleeing real persecution. There are Nigerian Christians who face death for their faith. There are Ukrainians fleeing war. In decades past, Canada opened its doors to Vietnamese boat people escaping communism. These are the people our asylum system should protect. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924782">My own father fled Communist East Germany with nothing but his hands, his family and the hope that Alberta would be a place where his children could live freely and safely. He came to Canada the fair and legal way. He never cut corners or skipped the line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924783">When false claims flood the system, it is real refugees and hard-working Canadians who pay the price. Our housing crisis worsens. Emergency rooms are overwhelmed. Many Canadians still do not have a family doctor. Classrooms are overcrowded. Teachers are struggling and students are falling behind. All across the country, essential services are stretched beyond capacity, and we need a system that protects the most vulnerable, not one that rewards abuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924784">Our asylum system was designed to help those fleeing persecution, in accordance with the 1951 UN refugee convention. It was never intended to become a back door for economic migration, but that is exactly what is happening under the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924785">Social media posts are now encouraging temporary residents to claim asylum as a way to stay in Canada after their student visas or work permits expire. This is a dangerous trend. It undermines the credibility, the capability and the fabric of our immigration system and hurts those who truly need Canada's protection. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924786">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, in parts 5 through 8, proposes several changes to our immigration and refugee system, but these changes do not go nearly far enough. The bill would largely shift responsibility away from the government and onto the courts, and it would permit certain actions through regulation instead of legislating clear, enforceable rules. Without strong enforcement mechanisms, meaningful change will not follow.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924787">The bill also includes a proposed change to the safe third country agreement, but it fails to explain how or when it will be negotiated with the United States. In the meantime, Canada continues to accept asylum claims from G7 countries that are safe, democratic and fully capable of protecting their own citizens.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8924788">The Liberal government's record on immigration and refugee integrity is clear: The backlog has soared, the rules are weak and the system is being abused.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924789"> Conservatives believe in a compassionate and rules-based immigration system, one that prioritizes those most at risk, treats Canadians and newcomers with respect and restores integrity to the asylum process. Future performance is best demonstrated by past behaviour, and the Liberal government has not shown us anything promising in the last 10 years. Only Conservatives will stand up for Canadians' individual freedoms, their safety and the integrity of the systems that make this country strong.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8924826">Mr. Speaker, today, the House is debating Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, a reincarnation of Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>. Bill C‑2 sparked a great deal of criticism regarding privacy rights, so the government was forced to go back and make revisions. It has returned with a new version of Bill C‑2, now called Bill C‑12.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924827">The main difference we see is the removal of the controversial elements of Bill C‑2 involving invasion of privacy, most of which were found in part 4 of the bill. They would have allowed Canada Post and customs officers to open people's mail. These provisions drew heavy criticism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924828">Generally speaking, we in the Bloc Québécois were already open to working on Bill C‑2, sending it to committee, and working collaboratively on moving it forward. With Bill C‑12, we have even more reason to want to see this bill advance. We are keeping an open mind and are willing to work with all members of the House and with the witnesses who will testify in committee. I will not have the opportunity to sit on that committee, but I wish I could. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924829">Without going into a comprehensive analysis of the bill, I will nonetheless raise a number of points that merit our attention. The first is part 1, which makes amendments to the Customs Act to expand customs officers' law enforcement powers, including access to facilities. It is that access to facilities that I wish to discuss.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924830">Often, when CBSA officers inspect goods, they are goods coming into the country. Goods leaving the country, however, are usually not inspected, and this causes all sorts of problems, as the media recently reported. These include auto theft, a crime that is plaguing Ontario, Quebec and, presumably, the rest of Canada as well. Resources are an issue, of course, but there is also the matter of facilities for doing the work, especially in rail yards. If they want to pull a rail car out for examination, for example, they need a place to put it. There will now be an obligation to provide facilities so customs officers can do their job. Without facilities, without dedicated areas for the inspection of goods, this was becoming problematic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924831">One of the problems raised by customs officers was that they needed to get a warrant every time they wanted to open a container. The process was becoming difficult, complicated and time-consuming. The bill includes measures that would make it easier for them to open containers as needed and inspect the goods inside without the many authorizations required in the past. We see that as something positive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924832">However, this provision raises the challenge of resources. We can provide customs officers with all the extra authority, infrastructure and facilities we like, but if there are not enough officers to do the work, we have a problem. The Liberals, incidentally, made that promise during the last election campaign. They promised 1,000 more customs officers and 1,000 more RCMP officers. Although one of these two promises—the one concerning the RCMP—made its way into the Speech from the Throne, we are still waiting to see whether it had any tangible impact on RCMP staffing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924833">As for the CBSA, the wait continues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924834">Also, will the 1,000 additional employees mentioned in the government's election promise be enough? The answer is no. The Customs and Immigration Union says that 2,000 to 3,000 people are needed. The election promise covers one-third, and we do not even know whether the government is really going to try to keep the promise, because we have no indication that it is really going to give the CBSA what it needs to do a reasonable job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924835"> We know that it takes resources to secure the borders and deal with illegal immigration, arms trafficking, drug trafficking and auto theft. Unfortunately, that is not in the bill, because bills do not prescribe the hiring of staff. If it could be done, however, perhaps it should be, to ensure that this government hires the necessary staff to do the work that needs to be done at our borders.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8924836">Another point that we would like to address with respect to this bill is part 4, which amends the Oceans Act to allow a minister other than the Minister of Fisheries to be responsible for the Coast Guard. Essentially, this would transfer the Coast Guard from the Department of Fisheries to the Department of National Defence. We completely agree with that. Transferring the Coast Guard to the Department of National Defence was actually in the Bloc Québécois's election platform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924837">From an accounting standpoint, it would make it possible to increase defence spending, enabling Canada to fulfill some of its commitments in that area and enhancing coordination between the two services. We know that the Coast Guard is not armed, and this occasionally limits its scope of intervention. Placing it under the Department of Defence would, at a minimum, enhance coordination and information sharing with the Department of Defence, particularly when it comes to interventions that require the presence of National Defence or individuals who are better equipped to face a possible threat. For that reason, we think part 4 is very positive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924838">I will now turn to part 7. Obviously, I will not go through all the sections. Part 7 of the bill grants more powers to immigration officers to suspend, vary or cancel a visa or document under conditions to be prescribed in regulations. Immigration officers will be given more powers to suspend or vary visas, but the details will be prescribed in regulations. That is all interesting, but we would have preferred to see more details. Bills always provide more certainty than regulations do. Governments always want to have more flexibility, but we do not necessarily agree. We will see how this goes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924839">The bill also adds an interesting provision that would allow the minister to personally suspend, refuse to process or cancel permanent or temporary resident visas, work permits, electronic travel authorizations or study permits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924840">We think that is quite interesting, because we know that there have been many allegations of fraud in relation to permits and visas. The problem is that if people obtained documents, visas or resident status fraudulently, we should not simply allow them to run loose without taking any action. We should not just say that now that they have a visa, there is nothing we can do. That is more or less what is happening now. With these kinds of powers, the minister will be able to share information with Public Safety and cancel these fraudulent visas and permits so that the government can take the kind of action that is long overdue. We applaud this step, though we wonder why it was not taken sooner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924841">We now turn to part 8, which is the most substantial part of the bill and the one that has got the most people talking. I think this is the part that will probably have the greatest impact. Part 8 addresses the Bloc Québécois's concerns regarding the safe third country agreement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924842">Under this agreement, a person wishing to claim asylum must do so in the first safe country they reach after leaving the country where they were in danger. However, we know that what often happened at Roxham Road was that people were leaving the United States and coming to Canada to file a claim for refugee protection because they believed that they had a better chance of being allowed to enter Canada or that they would receive better treatment in Canada. That led to a large influx of asylum seekers that Quebec had to take in, since Roxham Road is in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924843">We found that problematic because we felt that if someone were really in a life-threatening situation, they would not cherry-pick the country they want to settle in. They would go to the first country they could move to to be safe, and this is perfectly legitimate. We felt that this was a problem, but part 8 closes some loopholes. With the safe third country agreement, if a person could come to Canada and hide here for 14 days, they would not have to go back to the United States or another country and could file their claim in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924844">The new measure in the bill means that people will be sent back to their country after the 14 days. That means it is in their best interest to turn themselves in to the authorities quickly rather than go into hiding. We see that as a fairly positive thing. For the first 14 days, a person caught during that period would simply be sent back to the United States. Obviously, Canada does not have extradition agreements with all countries. This would not apply in those cases. Furthermore, people whose lives are in danger could still report that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8924845">Will this bill fix all the problems? No. Will it help solve some of them? Yes, absolutely. We wish the government had listened to us much sooner, because we know that Quebec—</ParaText>

Witnesses will come and tell us what needs to be done differently. However, the question we need to ask is this: Why did it take so long before something was done? The government has been in power for 10 years. We have been complaining about this situation, about the government's lax approach at our borders, for years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924852">Every time we raised the issue and proposed measures like the ones now set out in this bill, the government called us every name in the book, claiming that we were being unwelcoming. However, Quebec currently takes in 40% of asylum seekers in Canada, even though it represents only 20% of the country's population. That amounts to twice its demographic weight. This is a serious problem.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924855">Mr. Speaker, I cannot really comment specifically on part 7(a). Earlier, I spoke in general about part 7, which the Bloc Québécois saw as a positive because it seeks to combat certain fraudulent claims that might have been made or certain massive claims that might be made to bog down the system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924856">If the bill prevents fraudulent claims and attempts to bog down the system, then I think that is a good thing. Obviously, we will see whether further amendments are needed after hearing what the witnesses have to say in committee. After asking many of his colleagues the same question today, what I would have liked my Conservative colleague to tell me is whether the Conservatives agree that we need a fair distribution of asylum seekers across the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924858">As my colleague rightly pointed out, during the previous Parliament, when the Bloc Québécois highlighted the issues with foreign students and asylum seekers, the government did terrible damage to our reputation. We were called all sorts of names.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924859">When we made sensible proposals on immigration, the Liberal government took such an ideological stance that it could not listen to us, and now it realizes that our proposals were just common sense, to quote another opposition leader.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924861">Mr. Speaker, the real problem is that asylum seekers are supposed to be people who are coming here because they fear for their safety, because they are in danger in their own country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924862">However, we have seen that the asylum process increasingly became a completely separate immigration stream used to get around the regular immigration process. This was tolerated by the government and suited its purposes. When we spoke out about this situation, members on the other side of the House called us every name in the book. It was very problematic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924863">What is unfortunate is that we could have resolved this situation 10 years ago. Everything in this bill, or most of it, helps to address the problem. The system became bogged down and all sorts of crises were created, including the housing crisis, the homelessness crisis and the public service crisis, just because this government did not want to deal with the problems.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924864">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today on Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924865">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> touches upon immigration and border security, issues that matter deeply to the great people of Mission—Matsqui—Abbotsford.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924866">The bill is actually a direct result of Conservative leadership, our commitment to holding the government accountable and our pushing back against some of the divisiveness we saw in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>. Let us not forget that, after the election, Canadians were very clear with everyone across Parliament that we needed to work together and that they wanted to see leadership from the Conservative Party to put the best interests of Canadians forward. I think that what we are seeing here today, which is actually quite historical in the context of government legislation, shows to Canadians that, while we are willing to compromise, we are also standing firm in our principles about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924867">We supported the tax cuts the Liberals put forward. We supported measures to improve interprovincial trade, and today, we are supporting some long-standing measures in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> that would improve public safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924868">The bill before us today covers everything from border measures and money-laundering rules to sweeping surveillance powers buried deep within it. Excuse me. That was in the previous bill. In the previous bill, there were provisions on Canada Post and sweeping new surveillance powers. These are not included in the legislation, which many Canadians are thankful for. In fact, many of my constituents wrote to me, explaining that they did not want me to support a bill with such measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924869">In the new bill, in what we can see today, there are measures for the Canada Border Services Agency that would grant authority to inspect outgoing shipments in the same way that border services agents inspect imports. That is an important change. Canada has long monitored what comes into the country but not always what leaves. These new powers could help stop illegal exports, arms trafficking or the flow of fentanyl precursors across our borders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924870">According to Health Canada, between January 2016 and June 2024, more than 49,000 Canadians lost their lives to the opioid toxicity crisis. In the first half of 2024 alone, fentanyl was involved in nearly 80% of accidental opioid deaths, a 39% increase since national tracking began. In the last two years alone, police have dismantled major fentanyl labs in Langley, Falkland and the Hatzic valley in my own riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924871">Strengthening CBSA's ability to track and intercept illegal exports, particularly precursor chemicals used in fentanyl production, is a necessary step if we are serious about disrupting the flow of deadly opioids, which are taking lives unnecessarily in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924872">The bill would also amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to allow the <Affiliation DbId="318692" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> to quickly schedule new precursor chemicals used in fentanyl production. Conservatives support this because we have been calling for tougher and faster action in response to the opioid crisis for years. These are warranted powers for the minister. It would also give law enforcement officers clarity and legal protection while handling controlled substances during investigations, which makes sense from an operational perspective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924873">The bill would expand the Coast Guard's authority to share information with security and intelligence partners, and it modernizes how departments handle immigration and refugee files. It strengthens penalties for money laundering and terrorist financing by reforming FINTRAC, our national financial intelligence agency. Real reforms are needed to fix what the previous government broke, to rebuild trust in a fair, secure and efficient system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924874">I will note that it is a Liberal government that is fixing the problems of a previous Liberal government, but there are still problems with the bill. The Liberals have left too many details to regulation. Rather than writing clear, enforceable laws, they have chosen to permit future decisions through regulation, decisions that can be quietly changed by cabinet behind closed doors, with no parliamentary oversight. That means that the real power, in some cases, may remain in the hands of the ministers, not in the text of Canada's Criminal Code and accompanying legislation.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8924875">There is a lot of public interest in how refugee and immigration claims are being handled, and people want to know how the system is being managed responsibly. This is a pattern we have seen time and time again with the government. Whether it is how they spend, how they tax or how they regulate, the Liberals do prefer a regulatory approach over clarity, and secrecy over accountability. That is why the Conservatives will support Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> to committee, but we need to insist on a couple of things that I believe should be looked at closely when the bill is brought to the committee stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924876">The first is FINTRAC. We need to ensure Canada's financial intelligence agency has the proper tools and oversight to effectively tackle money laundering, transnational crime and the illicit flow of fentanyl that undermine both our economy and our border. From this bill alone, we cannot tell if it does a good enough job. We need to study that in detail at the committee stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924877">Second, we need to look very closely at the broad discretionary powers included in this bill. For example, it gives ministers wide latitude, particularly on immigration and refugee files. Committee study must examine whether these powers could be misused and how to include clear safeguards, because Canadians deserve a fair, transparent and accountable system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924878">Third, there is the CBSA's authority to inspect outgoing cargo. While these powers are essential for stopping criminal gangs and fentanyl traffickers, we must also ensure there is a balance. Trusted exporters, through the trusted exporter program, should not be burdened unnecessarily, and inspections must be targeted and reasonable. Again, we need to see this carefully addressed at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924879">From my first reading of the bill, I believe that by focusing on the three amendments, or things to be studied closely, we can hopefully strengthen the legislation to give our law enforcement the necessary tools to improve public safety and work toward improving trust in government institutions across our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924880">In British Columbia, I have seen containers ready for export to Asia full of stolen cars. I have seen the devastating impacts of fentanyl, which is destroying lives. Billions of dollars have been laundered into Canada's economy and, in some cases, it is driving up the price of real estate and increasing crime in our community. My hope is this bill takes some measurable steps to improve all the things Canadian society sees wrong with the way our institutions handle these critical issues.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924899">Mr. Speaker, the Liberals say that they want to secure our border, but they have filled Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> with nothing but half measures that fail to target the core issues. They will be unable to combat transnational organized crime when they value the well-being of repeat offenders over law-abiding citizens. They will be unable to get a handle on our asylum system when they value economic migrants with bogus asylum claims over legitimately vulnerable people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924900"> The Liberal half measures in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> stem from their continued inability to both set up and enforce disincentives against bad actors. Fundamentally, the Liberals take the maxim of the three wise monkeys to heart: See no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil. The Liberals do not see the criminals. They do not hear the vulnerable. When they choose not to see the bad actors and not to hear the downtrodden, they by all means speak half measures into being.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924901">Let us first address how Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would fail to secure our borders, from a crime angle. I have a simple question: Do hard drugs like fentanyl just magically appear in our country? No, of course they do not. Some group has to produce them, and some group has to distribute them. The drug dealers should not be the only central target for the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924902">The problem is that lax Liberal laws have altered our Criminal Code to put criminals first. Law-abiding Canadians live in fear, while repeat offenders serially reoffend against Canadian society, knowing there will be no consequences for their crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924903">The Liberals cannot just paper everything over with Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> while we still live in the madness legislated into being by Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>. They are building bridges to nowhere, upheld by pillars of sand. How much longer must the Conservatives bring up the failures of these two bills?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924904">Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> forces judges to apply a principle of restraint that puts repeat offenders back on the streets. Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> repealed mandatory jail time for serious offences, like extortion with a firearm or trafficking hard drugs like fentanyl. Thus, not only are we letting criminals with many offences roam free; we are also letting the ones who have performed the most serious offences at the highest frequency roam free. This is the pro-criminal world that the Liberals have legislated into being.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924905">How do we stop the Liberal madness? The first step is clear: Put law-abiding Canadians above the well-being of repeat offenders. When we put hard-working, law-abiding and tax-paying Canadians first, at the top of our hierarchy, the policy suite to serve them unfolds naturally. We must disincentivize the crime that harms our law-abiding society, by locking up the repeat offenders rather than letting them roam free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924906">It is not hard to understand how disincentives work. When a toddler touches a hot stove and burns their hand, they will learn not to touch the stove again. Through this feedback loop, the child will learn not to repeat the mistake. Human behaviour is like a river flowing down a mountain. We can either dig grooves to enhance the flow down one path, or we can build dams to block the flow down another. The Liberals have been allowing the river of crime to flow unimpeded. We Conservatives plan on setting up some more dams.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924907">Having addressed the failure of Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> to secure our borders on the drug front, let me redirect attention to how Bill C-12 would fail to do so on the asylum front as well. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8924908">Canada's asylum system was set up to protect truly vulnerable people, like those from Hong Kong or Ukraine. We cannot resettle every economic migrant claiming asylum to get a free hotel stay. However, this is our current state of affairs. We have made the asylum route a lucrative one and have incentivized it. We give hotel rooms to people with bogus asylum claims, while hard-working Canadians struggle with housing, health care and jobs amidst a general cost of living crisis, and while legitimately vulnerable people from Hong Kong and Ukraine have been left in limbo on their path to permanent residence, despite already being in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924909">All that Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would accomplish is to shift the burden to the courts, which is another half measure among half measures, as the Liberals choose not to see the bad actors and choose not to hear the vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924910">Let me bring my Liberal colleagues the voices of the vulnerable. I was shocked to discover that on October 9, the estimated time for processing individuals under the Hong Kong pathways to permanent residence was revised to being upwards of 10 years. My constituency staff have seen the processing times for cases of applications that have been situated in the IRCC pipeline for years jump from 25 months to 48 months after the October 9 threshold. For those who submitted their application this summer, processing times went from 25 months at submission to 10 years after October 9 . In the best of cases, it is a doubling of processing, and in the worst of cases, it is a quintupling of processing. In all cases, there are lives ruined and families put in peril.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924911">Hong Kongers are a case study of a people that has integrated into our society. They do not take handouts. They are taxpayers who contribute to the system instead of getting free hotel stays on the backs of hard-working Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924912">The Liberals can secure our borders from their out-of-control asylum system by removing all the benefits. A single action like this would have sweeping effects, and yet the Liberals have chosen the path of half measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924913">In conclusion, my message today about Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> can be expressed in two concepts: incentives and disincentives. All we have to do is to stop incentivizing behaviours we no longer wish to see and to start disincentivizing behaviours we want to end. We cannot secure our borders with half measures that dance around the core problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924914">People are the actors; people do things, so to stop bad actors from doing bad things, we must build systems of incentives and disincentives around the bad actors themselves. This is only impossible to do when we actually love and esteem the bad actors above the hard-working, law-abiding and taxpaying Canadians. As it stands, structurally, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> does not see the bad actors and does not hear the legitimately vulnerable. Bill C-12 is a bundle of half measures that would not secure our borders.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924936">Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to participate in the debate on this split border bill, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924937"> My riding of Niagara South is a border riding. The town of Fort Erie borders the city of Buffalo. The connection between Canada and the United States in my riding runs deep in our DNA. Everyone I know in every part of my riding has ties to western New York. Crossing the Peace Bridge was like simply crossing the street. Relationships and, indeed, every aspect of our region are, or were, tied to something or someone in the Buffalo or Niagara Falls, New York area. We cheered for the Sabres, of course, unless the Leafs were in town, in which case the KeyBank Center in Buffalo was often filled with a majority of Canadians. We were part of the Bills Mafia and lined up to cross the bridge to tailgate with our American friends. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924938">We do not so much anymore. I am incredibly saddened by the current issues we are facing: trade disputes, tariffs and the strain and stress those are placing on literally thousands of people employed in my riding because we are a border community. Our cross-border business ties have become part of the very bone structure of Niagara South. Niagara South is a great example of what can be built with strong trade links and binational and international commerce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924939">I spent a lifetime in the local business community helping people grow their enterprises, commercialize their products and find markets in and outside Canada. We have struggled over the past 10 years with the brain drain of ideas flowing south to where capital is more readily available. Recent market machinations mean that our already-weakened innovation sector is at even greater risk. We are in a kind of economic purgatory right now. We have caved to Donald Trump after a decade of missed opportunities, failed industrial and innovation policy and declining productivity. We are now watching the Stellantis deal literally implode before our eyes, losing a long-term key investment and 3,000 jobs. This is a massive failure. There are repercussions to our trade failure, which the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said is a rupture. It is an interesting case study in economic impotence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924940"> Canadians want solutions, but the government has proposed none. The silence on the file, outside of platitudes and bold but meaningless political hyperbole, tells me that the guy who said he could deal with Trump is appeasing him or simply hoping to wait him out. The guy who said he would engage in nation-building projects simply announced old ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924941">In my riding, the Peace Bridge is one of the most critical border crossings in Canada, facilitating over $50 billion in trade every year. Tourism from our American friends also drove our local economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924942">An issue that came up during the election relates again, to the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie. Transport Canada invested $5 million, and the Peace Bridge authority also invested $5 million, to build new infrastructure to scan commercial vehicles leaving Canada. This is called the Peace Bridge pre-arrival readiness evaluation project, or PARE.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924943">Multi-energy portal technology exists to scan the contents of trailers, containers and vehicles while the vehicle continues to move at around 10 kilometres an hour through the scanning lanes. It identifies what is actually inside these vehicles. We know that only a small percentage of containers in the major ports in Canada are actually inspected. This is why thousands of stolen cars are being exported to distant criminal markets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924944">This MEP technology is universally used in southern U.S. ports of entry and exit and can provide a full inventory of contents within a minute or two. This technology is not new, but for some reason Canada has dropped the ball on this in the most egregious way. Canada and taxpayers invested $10 million to build the infrastructure for this scanning equipment at the base of the Peace Bridge on the Canadian side two years ago. Guess what. The United States government invested $30 million, literally giving us this technology here in Canada. All we had to do was build the infrastructure, and we did. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924945">Unfortunately, Canadian bureaucracy has held this project up because we cannot seem to get the Canadian nuclear regulatory authority to green-light the technology, a technology already safely and widely deployed around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924946">For over a year now, this infrastructure has lain unused at the base of the Peace Bridge and the scanning equipment has sat in storage somewhere in Baltimore, waiting for the Canadian government to live up to its end of the bargain. This technology is pretty amazing. Using state-of-the-art scanning, we can get a full history of the trucks that cross the border, such as driving records, the track record of the company crossing, e-manifest verifications and facial recognition for matching driver identity. We get a complete data package on the vehicle in minutes. This expedites trade and safety. It lowers emissions and commercial congestion. It expedites the identification of contraband and stolen goods.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924947">Last week, I heard a minister across say something about scanning equipment being put into the budget, but I am not sure who it was. If this technology is being considered, my question is this: What took the government so long?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924948">The government is talking big about beefing up our security at borders. This bill is supposed to have a major role in this, but we have been standing on the shoreline of this project and missed the proverbial boat to solve one of the most pressing problems plaguing Canadians right now: the theft and export of stolen vehicles. Even ministers of the Crown are not immune to this, one having had his vehicle stolen twice. The anxiety Canadians feel over the lack of response to this epidemic is palpable. We no longer feel safe in our safe zones and neighbourhoods.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924949">The <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was in Niagara last week reannouncing old announcements. I would bet a dollar or two that he had no idea this technology was sitting at the base of the Peace Bridge. If he really wanted to look at game-changing opportunities, he would have stood there and fixed the bureaucratic logjam. Instead, he regurgitated old announcements and called it news.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924950">I wrote to the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="318668" Type="4">Minister of Energy and Natural Resources</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="322413" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> in July urging them to get involved and fast-track this technology out of the bureaucratic logjam. Four months later, it is crickets. Is it any wonder Trump is taking advantage of us? We cannot even launch a project that is already built.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924951">What about those 1,000 new jobs at the border? We have been hearing about these extra 1,000 border officers, a high-profile announcement with zero action. I have qualified constituents who have been waiting for months after applying with no response and no callback. No one at the CBSA has an idea of how this can be done. There is simply not enough training capacity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924952">There are other issues facing the CBSA that need to be fixed. Suicide rates in the organization have rocked its members. We need to pay attention to the entire cultural structure before making absurd political announcements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924953">Finally, I need to talk about one very serious issue related to this bill. Proposed section 6 requires operators of international border crossings, like the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie and the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls, to provide existing, new or significantly expanded assets free of charge to the CBSA upon a simple request.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924954">The Peace Bridge, unlike others in Canada, is owned by and operated through a binational authority, with no taxpayer or public funding. The operations of the bridge are managed through independent revenue streams or, in simple terms, tolls. This legislation imposes a blanket requirement on the Government of Canada to demand investment in new infrastructure without a financial contribution. This is an open-ended and serious flaw in the legislation. What it means directly is that, for non-federally owned or controlled border bridges, the only way to pay for capital expansion for federal freebies is through tolls. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924955">There are federally owned bridges, such as Blue Water Bridge, Thousand Islands Bridge and Seaway International Bridge. Under proposed section 6, the costs would be borne by the government because it owns these border crossings, which is not the case with the Peace Bridge. This is a classic government download on the consumer and a lack of organizational understanding. Worse, it manifestly disregards the interests of local residents. The government needs to look at this unfair provision and make changes to ensure there is a level playing field. The legislation imposes a double standard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924956"> There is so much more I could talk about regarding this bill, but time does not permit. There are serious issues to fix here. I hope the government will pay attention to the points I have raised. My riding's economy, people, businesses and jobs are inextricably linked to Canada and U.S. trade. Please let there be no absurd reannouncements of old projects. We have real problems to fix.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924978">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, which is what is listed today under Government Orders. We have a very strange situation at the moment in that the bill is substantially similar, with the same title and almost all the same sections, to Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, which remains on the Order Paper. I draw attention to that as I go over the rules only because this is, to me, an unprecedented experience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924979">I have not been in this place forever, only since 2011, but I have never seen the government introduce two bills that are substantially the same. Sometimes, there is a private member's bill and we look at the order of precedence. As I read the rules, I think the government is within its rights to have two bills that have the same title and are substantially the same, but at the moment that it chooses one to put forward for a vote, we will know that the other one is withdrawn, because we cannot vote on two bills that are the same in the same session.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924980">As a member of Parliament, I wonder what kind of game the government is playing with this. These are both government bills. Why is Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> still in the order of precedence, and why are we getting nonsense statements from Liberal members, who have said Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> builds on Bill C-2? That is clearly not what is happening here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924981"> Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> is an omnibus bill whose title is about stronger borders, and it references many other pieces of legislation within it. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> does the same. As some of my hon. Conservative colleagues have already noted, the parts that have been removed are those that were the most obviously egregious. The idea that the Canada Post Corporation Act has to be changed is in Bill C-2, but not in Bill C-12. It would allow people to open our mail in case there might be controlled substances. There are also the parts that would allow information from our Internet accounts to be accessed and shared. This is a source of real concern for Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924982">Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> is an omnibus bill touching on 10 different bills. I think Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is down to touching on eight different bills now. It would change the Customs Act, the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the Oceans Act, the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Sex Offender Information Registration Act and the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act. I have not read all of them into the record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924983">Omnibus bills are a problem, because when we deal with subjects that may be somewhat related but are sufficiently different, they should be studied separately. They should not be put together and called an omnibus bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924984">In this case, omnibus Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> attracted omnibus opposition. A broad coalition of over 200 civil society organizations put together a demand to Parliament before we resumed in September, as the original Bill C-2 was tabled in the spring. It attracted concern from civil liberties organizations, refugee protection groups and migrant protection organizations. I can mention some of the groups by name.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924985"> Specifically, over 300 organizations called for Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> to be withdrawn, including the Canadian Labour Congress, the United Church of Canada, the Migrant Rights Network, the Canadian Council for Refugees, Amnesty International, OpenMedia, Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights, Climate Action Network Canada, the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers and the Canadian Muslim Lawyers Association. They all called for a full withdrawal of Bill C-2. I have not read all of the groups' names into the record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924986">Now we have Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>. Have these groups said the government has heard their concerns and, obviously, Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> is going to be withdrawn? No. Bill C-2, as I mentioned, is still on the Order Paper. More than that, though, removing the parts that were in Bill C-2 from Bill C-12 does not make Bill C-12 acceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924987">I am going to quote Matt Hatfield, the executive director of OpenMedia, one of the many civil society organizations concerned about this bill. This is his position on privacy rights and other aspects of the way in which Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is still offensive. He said, “The story of this legislative package is the same today as it was on day one of Bill C-2’s introduction; it’s about pleasing President Trump”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8924988"> Like the preceding speaker from Niagara, my riding is also a border riding. Saanich—Gulf Islands is on the Salish Sea, which is an ecological region shared with Washington state. The Gulf Islands referenced in the title of my riding, Saanich—Gulf Islands, are close relatives, one might say, to the San Juan Islands. They have the same ecosystem. The same endangered whales go through both waters of the Salish Sea, and whales and salmon do not carry passports.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924989">The indigenous people of Washington state, the Lummi Nation, are relatives to the Saanich people I am honoured to represent here in this place. They are intrinsically linked, and our borders are strong in that we respect each other's nationalities. I have to say, there are certain strains when the Mariners are playing the Jays, but never mind. Let us set that aside. In my riding, we cheer for the Jays. This is clear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924990">On Friday last week, we had a cross-border forum and invited into Saanich—Gulf Islands representatives from local governments, indigenous governments, NGOs and civil society groups, and we all agreed that we are still neighbours and friends. We do not like Trump's tariffs and we do not want to kowtow to him, but we want to deepen the relationships that exist between us. We would really like to get our ferry service back, by the way, between Anacortes, Washington, and Sidney, British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924991"> We can deepen relationships, but given the strong border language and the rhetoric around this, I have to agree with the comment from OpenMedia. The language in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is all about pleasing Donald Trump.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924992">What gets offended in the process? I used to practise refugee law. I was a lawyer in Halifax, and in those days, the refugees I helped were mostly ship-jumpers. With nothing more than the clothes on their back, they escaped from eastern bloc and Warsaw Pact countries, like Romania, came to Halifax Harbour and found themselves a lawyer. Generally, that was me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924993"> I was so grateful for this. It has been mentioned a few times in debates that Canadians would hate the idea that we provided hotel rooms, which we did. I will never forget the brilliant young man who called me, probably four decades later, after I got elected, and wanted me to know how he had done in Canada once I helped him get a hotel room in Halifax and start his refugee claim. He started and ran a small construction company and had a number of sons, who are still running his construction company. He was awfully glad we had immediate help for refugees and did not require that they cross at the proper border. Sometimes, a person crosses where they can, with the clothes on their back. This is why I am proud I was a practising member of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers. It is also absolutely opposed to what is being proposed here in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, and remain so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924994">Going back to the fact that it is an omnibus bill, this means it is not going to go to the immigration committee for proper study with enough witnesses and experts brought to bear to say, “This is what is wrong with this bill, and this is how we might fix it.” The Green Party still maintains that these issues are not fixable and that both Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> should be withdrawn immediately. In the meantime, the greater likelihood is that they will not be. The Liberals have caved to what the Conservatives demanded in this place, and I thank those on the Conservatives benches who demanded it, but they are not demanding enough. Both bills should be withdrawn immediately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8924995">Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> had egregious sections regarding the post office and the Internet, but Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is still unacceptable. It has provisions that invade privacy and hurt refugees, with innocent people caught in the gears of what is now an increasingly Trumpian world. We do not have to accept that. We can make laws that work for Canadians and for those who legitimately need our protection. Canadians will always want to say “elbows up”, but with arms outstretched to the world.</ParaText>

In particular, it is because of other drugs, precursors of other drugs and illegal weapons coming from the U.S. into Canada.

              <ParaText id="8925013">After a long decade of nihilistic Liberal rule, chaos and disorder reign supreme in our streets. Criminality may be only one of the many problems Canadians face, but it is a significant one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925014">A survey by Abacus Data released this year, in 2025, found that 46% of Canadians ranked crime and public safety among their top concerns. This can be contrasted with an Ipsos poll taken in June 2015, the year our previous Conservative government left office, which found that 15% of Canadians ranked crime and violence among the issues on the national agenda at the time. I will let Canadians ponder those two statistics to find out just who has been a better steward of peace, safety and security in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925015">Canadians understand that the situation is untenable. After all, it is they who have had to shoulder the burden of this rise in criminality in our communities. For context, since 2015, violent crime has spiked significantly, and it is up nearly 50%. That is not all; crime of almost every category has seen an increase: Sexual assaults are up nearly 75%, homicides are up 28%, gang-related homicides and organized crime have increased by 75%, violent firearms offences with illegal guns are up 116%, extortion is up 357%, auto theft is up 46%, and trafficking is up nearly 84%. Fraud, homicide and anything we can name are all going up. I could continue, but I think my colleagues get the picture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925016">This upswing in violence is not a coincidence; it is a result of soft-on-crime policies and a porous border. It is the realization of the law of unintended consequences brought on by a decade of bad policy, informed by a world view that cares more about optics than it concerns itself with the real-life effects of its own self-serving ideological agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925017">We now have a so-called government that is presenting bills in the House that purport to fix this collection of self-inflicted issues that Canadians face. These are the same problems that the members across the aisle from me created. In 2015, our Conservative government oversaw a Canada that had its lowest total crime rate since 1969. Unfortunately, the last 10 years has seen this progress almost completely erased.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925018">It is the hypocrisy of the government that it has opposed and demonized those who support our hard-on-crime agenda while now implicitly acknowledging that Conservatives were right all along.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925019">How did we get here? In 2022, Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> was passed. In this piece of legislation, the Liberal government removed the mandatory minimums on 14 different Criminal Code offences. These were common-sense penalties on dangerous offences that were instituted and put in place by our Conservative government; these were bills that I proudly passed when I sat on the other side of the House. They include using a firearm or imitation firearm in the commission of an offence, which people do not have to go to jail for anymore in Canada, thanks to Liberals. Possession of a firearm or weapon, knowing that its possession is unauthorized, so illegal possession of a gun, for example, is another offence that people no longer have to go to jail for. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925020">Possession of a prohibited or restricted firearm with ammunition is an offence that people do not have to go to jail for anymore. Possession of a weapon obtained by the commission of an offence, so if someone steals a gun, they do not have to go to jail. Weapons trafficking, possession for purposes of weapons trafficking and smuggling, so someone can smuggle weapons now, in this country, and not go to jail. Importing or exporting knowing it is unauthorized is another example of smuggling; someone can traffic smuggled firearms, guns, ammunition, weapons or anything we can name. Discharging a firearm with intent and discharging a firearm recklessly are offences that people no longer need to go to jail for. If someone wants to commit a robbery, they might as well do it with a gun, because they do not have to go to jail for that either in this country anymore. Did I not just say that extortion is up 357% since 2015? The mandatory minimum penalty for extortion with a firearm is gone thanks to Bill C-5 and thanks to the Liberals and the NDP, which supported them at the time.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925021">In fact, these policies were all informed by expert opinion, yet the Liberals did not seem to care. Instead, before passing Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document>, they doubled down and passed Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> during their majority tenure from 2015 to 2019. The bill eased bail provisions and legislated the principle of restraint, which was codified in the Criminal Code for police and courts to ensure that criminals would be released at the earliest possible opportunity with the least amount of restrictions. Essentially, this favours release over detention; it is precisely these two bills, along with a copious number of bad decisions made, that created the revolving door in our justice system by which offenders are free to continue to terrorize communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925022">While the Liberals were making life easier for criminals by passing Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, they increased their attacks on law-abiding firearms owners, who are in no way responsible for any of this crime wave. They did so with a trifecta of bills with zero public safety value. These bills include Bill <Document DbId="9710291" Type="3">C-71</Document>, which created a backdoor gun registry; the 2020 order in council, a massive list of newly restricted firearms; and Bill <Document DbId="11814598" Type="3">C-21</Document> in 2023, which created a national freeze on the sale, purchase and transfer of handguns for law-abiding citizens and sport shooters, as well as a new prohibition on many long guns used for hunting and sport-shooting purposes. Since the passing of these bills, the government has not stopped adding firearms to the restricted list.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925023">The Liberals have now embarked on their so-called voluntary assault-style firearms compensation program, the gun grab, which is a program to confiscate guns from law-abiding citizens. It completely misses the mark by letting criminals go free and going after people who follow the law. If implemented, this costly and ineffective gun buyback is estimated to cost at least $5 billion, even though only $742 million has been allocated to it. With that kind of money, the government could easily fund such programs as acquiring modern scanning technology at our 119 ports of entry to secure our border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925024">I have an example to share that I also brought up during the committee hearings on Bill <Document DbId="11814598" Type="3">C-21</Document>. In the Cayman Islands, a high-efficiency scanner was bought. Someone can drive right through it in a truck, or a sea-can can go through it. It can be put at any port of entry. It will scan a container. It is safe for anyone who happens to be going through, and it will find all manner of contraband: drugs, people, firearms and illegal weapons. Those are about $3 million U.S. apiece.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925025">The Liberal government is going to spend $750 million to take lawfully acquired property away from Canadians. That is about $500 million U.S. If we divide that by $3 million per scanner, we could easily put 150 of these scanners at our ports of entry to make sure we scan at least 10% of all containers coming in and going out. I think most Canadians would be shocked to realize that we do not scan a single container that leaves our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925026">The shocking thing about all of this is that, with the change in administration to the south, the administration has claimed that fentanyl was flowing from Canada into the United States and, as a result, was killing American citizens. We would think a prime minister in Canada would have said the flow of illegal guns across the border from the United States into Canada is killing Canadian citizens, pushed back on the American administration and stood up for law-abiding firearms owners in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925027">However, the Liberals did not do that, because they did not want to admit that it was illegal guns killing Canadians on the street. They wanted to maintain the mantra of going after law-abiding citizens. We know that because the current <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> said as much when he thought nobody was listening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925028">How does all of this relate to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>? If the last decade is any indication, the government has an issue understanding that policy work is a careful game of trade-offs. When enacting policy, we have to heed the law of unintended consequences and try to understand the downward effects a piece of legislation may have. The Liberals did not do their due diligence on crime, and I do not think they have done it on the border bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925029">When Conservatives forced the Liberals to back down on Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, we did so because we understand that the policies contained in Bill C-2 have unintended consequences and unforeseen ramifications. As with Bill C-2, we believe there could be provisions in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> that violate people's freedoms and privacy, and it is our duty to ensure that Bill C-12 receives the proper scrutiny it deserves at the committee stage to ensure Canadians do not pay for another boondoggle of unintended, or not unintended, consequences.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925050">Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to speak to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C‑12</Document>, which deals with border security and immigration and follows on from an earlier bill, Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C‑2</Document>. The government ultimately came back with Bill C‑12. We are now discussing this whole matter of border security and immigration against the backdrop of these two successive bills.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925051">Of course, we will study Bill C‑12 at committee with the thoroughness we always bring to any examination of this subject. This legislation is necessary, but we want to ensure it is complete. Among other matters, we will be discussing the lack of human resources at the Canada Border Services Agency, or CBSA, and the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925052">The Bloc Québécois is committed to improving this bill at committee with the same goal in mind, specifically, having a border that operates efficiently, humanely, and in a way that respects people's rights. I am especially interested in this question since I grew up not far from the border with our American neighbours, I come from a region in southern Quebec and my riding is not far from the border. I am therefore going to paint a general picture of the situation. I will then look at some numbers relating to certain problems that are addressed in the bill, and I will close by saying a few words that pertain more to women and seniors, files for which I am responsible as the Bloc Québécois critic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925053">The first general observation we can make is that understaffing is a major issue. The Liberals promised to hire 1,000 additional RCMP officers and 1,000 additional CBSA officers. What progress has been made on that front? An announcement was made for the RCMP, but there has been no mention of the CBSA. According to the Customs and Immigration Union, they are currently short 2,000 to 3,000 officers. This means they have neither the tools nor the human resources needed to do their work effectively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925054">The Bloc Québécois is calling for patrols between border crossings to be authorized. That is what we are asking for. We are also calling for more operational flexibility and a real hiring plan. Regarding all of these Bloc Québécois proposals, I would like to commend the work of my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="318056" Type="2">Beauharnois—Salaberry—Soulanges—Huntingdon</Affiliation>, who has been working on this bill as the public safety critic. She does a really thorough job of it and has had several meetings. Our position is well documented. It is based on facts, not disinformation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925055">I would now like to provide a few figures, since Bill C‑12 deals with auto theft and organized crime. Over 100,000 vehicles are stolen every year in Canada. That is a 48% increase since 2020. There is also an economic cost to all of this: Claims totalled $1.5 billion in 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925056">I have had lunch with insurance company officials, and I can say that this is a real problem. They want us to deal with the situation. Interpol finds more than 200 stolen vehicles a week. In Quebec, there was a 57% increase in thefts between 2021 and 2023. The CBSA is often unable to inspect trains because it lacks the necessary infrastructure. Bill C‑12 fixes that with mandatory access to warehouses and train yards. The Bloc Québécois wants to see this implemented. It may be helpful, but it will be somewhat ineffective if all the necessary staff and resources are not in place. I think that with these figures, we are showing our Liberal colleagues that crime is on the rise. There is no denying that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925057">Fentanyl is also a problem, but let us approach it from a public health perspective. This is no trivial matter: There were 42,000 opioid-related deaths between 2016 and 2023, and 70% of those deaths involved fentanyl. The minister has the power to quickly add chemical precursors to the list of prohibited substances. That cannot hurt. The important thing is to save lives and protect families. Behind the statistics are human tragedies. We therefore support the measure, but we also demand rigorous monitoring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925058">As my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="318092" Type="2">Montcalm</Affiliation>, our health critic, would say, we need to address the opioid problem holistically, combining several approaches, particularly in terms of public health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925059">With regard to immigration and asylum seekers, there are new rules. Asylum claims become inadmissible after one year in Canada. Irregular entry for more than 14 days results in removal to the country of origin. The aim of all this is to cut down on abuse and backlogs.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8925060">Quebec welcomed 55% of the 180,000 asylum seekers in Canada in 2023, which is a staggering number. Obviously, there is no denying that this has had an impact on public services, which are already saturated and overloaded, particularly schools, health care and community services. The Bloc Québécois hopes that Ottawa will rebalance the distribution of asylum claims and transfer the promised funds to Quebec to welcome claimants in a dignified and acceptable manner. That is our demand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925061">In Canada, money laundering and illicit financing activities are estimated to be between $45 billion and $113 billion annually. The bill provides for new measures and increased collaboration, particularly between the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee and law enforcement agencies. In cases of non-compliance, fines will be multiplied by 40. The bill aims to improve and increase information sharing, but that requires caution in terms of privacy protection. The Bloc Québécois supports this modernization but is demanding that individual freedoms be protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925062">When it comes to protecting rights, what has been taken out of this bill compared to what was in Bill C‑2? Mail searches have been scrapped. That was an invasion of privacy. Restrictions on $10,000 donations have been dropped, and so has the collection of private data. The Bloc Québécois is in favour of that, because there really needs to be a balance between security and freedom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925063">Most importantly, Quebec wants a secure border, a fair immigration system and respect for its areas of jurisdiction. People forget this, but these are the demands of Quebec, on whose behalf the Bloc Québécois speaks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925064">I am going to talk a little more about the issues that concern me. As my party's critic for women and families, I want to expand the issue of crime and its impact. Women are often responsible for household budgets, so they are on the front lines of the cost-of-living crisis. There are proven links between economic insecurity and social insecurity, and between poverty and financial stress, which increase the risk of violence and distress.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925065">By cracking down on criminal networks linked to fentanyl, fraud and exploitation, we are reducing the economic and social pressure on women and children. Security must also be viewed from a social, economic and human perspective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925066">Seniors are increasingly being recognized as among the primary victims of crime and inflation. They are increasingly targeted by theft, fraud and scams, with over 35% affected in 2024. The rising cost of living only makes them more vulnerable. More than 55% of seniors who are renters spend more than 30% of their income on housing. Vehicle theft and fraud are causing insurance premiums to go up, which impacts people living on fixed retirement incomes. The cost of housing, an essential need, is on the rise because of money laundering in the real estate sector, which totals between $20 billion and $30 billion annually. Organized crime and the underground economy undermine seniors' incomes and deprive the government of resources that could be used to fund affordable housing, home care, and support programs for seniors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925067">For the Bloc Québécois, strengthening economic security also means protecting the dignity and financial peace of mind of seniors, as stated by FADOQ, which considers fraud against seniors to be a major political issue. According to this organization, seniors have become a prime target for phone scams, “grandparent” scams and bank fraud. It is calling for a review of the Criminal Code to strengthen minimum sentences for these types of offences. That is FADOQ's proposal, and we are willing to study it. The organization promotes awareness and prevention programs, particularly its Senior-Aware program, to educate seniors and equip them to deal with fraud. FADOQ has made it clear that education alone is not enough. Strong political and legal action is also needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925068">FADOQ often cites statistics from the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, which found that in 2024, more than 130,000 cases of fraud were reported across the country, with financial losses in excess of $650 million. The centre estimates, however, that only 5% to 10% of fraud is reported. People age 60 and over account for approximately 25% of reported victims, with average losses that are higher than in other age groups. Quebec is one of the hardest-hit provinces, mainly due to phone and bank scams.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925077">Mr. Speaker, the bill is coming at an interesting time, after 10 years of the Liberal government that has brought forth soft-on-crime policies that have weakened our border and have put Canada in the situation we are currently in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925078"> At the indigenous affairs committee, we are having a lot of discussion right now about first nations policing as well, and we are hearing about the increased gang activity and about drugs being brought into first nations across the country. We see it in northwestern Ontario in my riding. The government has ignored the calls from first nations or indigenous police services for more recognition and a better deal in terms of the resources and the structures they have in order to deal with a lot of the issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925079">The bill is being brought at a time when the government is making it easier to get bail, is failing first nations police services and is failing on a lot of counts when it comes to the border and to criminal justice.

In addition, I would be remiss if I did not mention that today the Royal Canadian Navy is celebrating Niobe Day; 115 years ago today marked the first day of a Canadian warship, the HMCS <I>Niobe</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925090"> It is a privilege to rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the strengthening Canada's immigration system and borders act. We are discussing the bill here today instead of Liberal Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, because Bill C-2 was met with considerable opposition from members of the House and from civil society groups that made it clear that the legislation would not be able to move forward without significant revisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925091">Therefore, today we are debating Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>. Despite the sweeping powers the government proposed in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, the Liberal government did not even bother to consult with the Privacy Commissioner about the impacts that the legislation would have on the privacy rights of Canadians. It is only because of the accountability provided by members of the opposition in the House that we were able to push that legislation back so we could focus on legislation that would at least try to repair the damage of the last 10 years of the Liberal government by introducing changes on the border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925092">The objectives of the bill, I will say for those constituents of mine who are watching at home, are several. They include but are not limited to creating an expedited pathway for the Minister of Health to add precursors chemicals used in the production of deadly drugs such as fentanyl as controlled substances under the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925093"> Over the past few years, we have seen the devastation of the fentanyl overdose crisis in Canada. At the public safety committee, we have been hearing about some of the many gaps we have in this country, including testimony that has indicated that the non-resident import program is being used to smuggle precursor chemicals into Canada with less stringency at the border, which is creating a situation where Canada has become a major producer of fentanyl, which is being exported. We have heard recent stories of countries like New Zealand and Australia being the recipients of drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamine. Clearly this is not the reputation that a great country like Canada wants to have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925094">Another part of the legislation seeks to amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act to eliminate the designated countries of origin regime, which has been identified as a loophole. It would give the minister the powers to specify that required documents are needed to support a refugee claim. It would require the suspension of certain refugee protection proceedings if the claimant is not present in Canada, something I think should be common sense; somebody should be present in Canada if they are claiming refugee status here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925095">It seeks to change the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act to increase the maximum monetary penalties for those charged under these acts. It also seeks to make certain changes to the Sex Offender Information Registration Act to allow for increased reporting of the offender's description, as well as changes to the circumstances and frequency of reporting. It would also allow for information previously collected to be disclosed if it can reasonably be expected to assist in the prevention or investigation of a crime of a sexual nature. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925096">Once again, I think these things are long overdue. We probably need to go even further, but we are certainly not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater on this one. Even with the second attempt at the legislation, the Liberal bill still fails to address the key issue of bail reform. We know that catch-and-release is alive and well for people who traffic in fentanyl and use illegal firearms, using our porous border to victimize more and more Canadian families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925097">We know that the sentencing provisions that were passed by the Liberal government under Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> have made it so that there no mandatory prison times for the people who traffic fentanyl, and there are still no new mandatory prison times for gangsters who use illegal guns to commit crimes, despite the Liberal government's incessant campaign against law-abiding gun owners. We also know that house arrest is still being used extensively in cases relating to violent criminals. Once again, this is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8925098">That said, I think we can all agree that strengthening our border is critical, and that is why legislation is desperately needed in this area. After 10 years of reckless Liberal policies, our border is broken, and we need to fix it. The Liberals' soft-on-crime agenda has made Canada a destination for international organized criminals trafficking in drugs, weapons, people and stolen cars. Gangs are committing brutal crimes on our streets every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925099">The public safety committee has looked at the issues in depth, and we have repeatedly heard it is the broken bail system that has contributed to the crisis. Organized criminals have chosen to make Canada their home because of our weak laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925100">We also know the government's failed immigration policies have assisted in making Canada a destination for international organized crime. In the past, the government has removed visa requirements over the objections of law enforcement agencies, which stated that the removal of visas would increase the risk of organized crime's taking root in this country. The government moved forward with it anyway, and it is critical that the policies be reversed so we can once again make Canada the safest country in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925101">I want to be clear that nothing I am saying today is a criticism of our brave frontline law enforcement officers in the RCMP and the CBSA. We know they are doing their absolute best. We have heard from police associations in Ontario. I have heard from RCMP members in my riding, when I was out knocking on doors during the past election, for example, that they are arresting people and seeing them back out on the street mere hours after being arrested for drug offences. How demoralizing this is for our frontline officers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925102">We have heard from Mark Weber of the Customs and Immigration Union, the union that represents CBSA workers, that morale at the CBSA is at the lowest level he has ever seen. This is after 10 years of the Liberal government. We now see that the government keeps recycling its promises to keep hiring more border services officers, but it is clear much more needs to be done to strengthen our border and our security service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925103">Canada has the largest undefended border in the world, which is something we can all be very proud of as a country, but the lack of resources for the CBSA to fulfill its role has seen a rise in smuggling and human trafficking in this country and people coming to this country to pursue their criminal activities. It has skyrocketed over the past decade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925104">The CBSA has been sounding the alarm, but the government has not been listening. There is plenty of evidence to substantiate these points, but I will pick one specific example. At the immigration committee, IRCC officials stated that they believe there are hundreds if not thousands of violent criminals who are here illegally, violent criminals who are not citizens or permanent residents. They are temporary residents who are violent people, and officials have no idea where they are. When I asked the customs union employee, they said that there are only a couple hundred CBSA officers who are tasked with trying to track down the thousands of violent criminals who are at large in this country. This is unacceptable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925105">On the non-violent side, we know there are currently around 50,000 people who have come to Canada on student visas and whose visas have now run out. They are here illegally, and CBSA does not have the resources to reach out to these people or to remove these people who are now in this country illegally. Despite the shockingly high figures, as I said, there are something like only 300 CBSA officers who have been dedicated to this gargantuan task.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925106">One of the reasons CBSA is suffering so much, as its union said, is that it is drowning in middle management. It is not getting the frontline officers it needs to do the job. This is endemic in everything the Liberal government has done for the last 10 years. Let us look at the great paradox, where we have a government where the bureaucracy has grown by 45% across the civil service yet there are fewer frontline workers in critical areas like the CBSA, the RCMP and the Canadian Armed Forces than ever before. How does that make any sense? The government is padding middle management and upper management, to the detriment of frontline workers who are doing the dangerous jobs we need them to do to keep us safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925107">Action is desperately needed, and the largest beneficiary of the government's failed immigration and criminal policies has been organized crime. Canada has become a low-risk, high-reward environment. Criminals choose the path of least resistance. The strict border controls put in place during the pandemic saw the Canadian market shift from being an importer of fentanyl to becoming a domestic producer. CSIS has found that synthetic drugs are increasingly being produced in Canada using precursor chemicals from China. This is what experts are saying. It is estimated that about 80% of the precursor chemicals that are being used in fentanyl—</ParaText>

When I was working as an assistant to the former member for Brome—Missisquoi, we were already talking about this key issue. At the time, it was the Conservatives who were making cuts that had major impacts on the operation of the border crossings.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925122">Mr. Speaker, we know that with the longest undefended border in the world, there is no way we could hire enough police officers or CBSA officers to man every inch of our border, and that is why we need to make investments in technology and equipment. However, when the government had the opportunity to hire Canadian workers and Canadian businesses, what did it do? It chose to hire Black Hawk helicopters from the U.S. government, and it had to give a Transport Canada waiver because the helicopters were not safe to fly over Canadian skies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925123"> Why are the Liberals choosing American companies over Canadian companies that do the job? We need to grow our made-in-Canada border security and not hire companies that have to get waivers because they are not safe to use in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925124">Mr. Speaker, it is once again an honour to rise on behalf of the resilient residents of Oshawa. Those are the residents who I believe are among some of the hardest-working Canadians in the country, but they are concerned about their safety. They are concerned about their safety when they are in their neighbourhoods and walking downtown, and they are concerned about border safety and the drugs that are freely flowing in our country, not just through the border, but from the free drugs people are getting from the government, which are being resold. We will talk about that later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925125">Canadians have heard a lot of big promises from the Liberal government about keeping our country safe, protecting our borders and restoring confidence in our immigration system. There are all of these wonderful things, yet after 10 years of Liberal government, both our borders and our public safety have rarely been in a worse place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925126">The legislation before us today is Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the strengthening Canada's immigration system and borders act, which the Liberals claim would fix the very problems they created. I am reminded of something I learned in my education, and that is something called narcissism. I bring this up because narcissists engage in what clinicians call “crisis creation” or “drama seeking”, which is to manufacture a situation. In my opinion, the Liberals have created the situations that allow them to dominate, control and be admired for saving others. They are keeping Canadians in constant trauma and creating, therefore, a trauma bond. The Liberal government constantly disappoints and then claims it is going to be the hero we can trust to come in to save the day from a crisis it created.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925127">The bill is being sold as a solution, but Canadians have learned that, with this government, the title rarely matches the contents. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is a sequel to Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>. Thankfully, Conservatives looked closer, and what we found were some sweeping data collection powers, warrantless search authorities and new threats to Canadian privacy. Therefore, through pressure, thankfully the Liberals have been forced to take Bill C-2 apart. Now we are left with Bill C-12, a slightly repackaged Bill C-2, but with many of the same problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925128">In my job as an educational therapist for 20 years, we talked about breakdown points, and sometimes it seems very negative to talk about breakdown points when we are talking about families, children with learning disabilities and things like that, but in this scenario, I think breakdown points are very important because we cannot come to a conclusion or a solution unless we discover what the breakdown points are, so let us talk about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925129">Canada's asylum system, once the envy of the world, is now buckling under the weight of Liberal mismanagement. A decade ago, the backlog was under 10,000 cases. Today, it is over a quarter of a million and growing. Legitimate refugees wait years while bogus claims clog the system. Failed claimants appeal for years, and more and more often remain in Canada indefinitely, collecting benefits that many Canadians themselves do not receive, so this is not compassion. This is the chaos creation I was speaking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925130">It started when the government decided it was going to play politics with our borders. In 2017, Justin Trudeau's #WelcomeToCanada tweet encouraged tens of thousands of people to cross illegally from the United States to claim asylum, many after already having been rejected in that safe, democratic country. Since then, more than 100,000 people have entered Canada illegally. Most are still waiting in the system, many housed at taxpayers' expense, while the truly vulnerable, those fleeing real persecution, are left behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925131">This is not fairness. It is, rather, failure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925132">A broken asylum system does not just strain compassion. It undermines public safety. We have seen the consequences at our borders and on our streets. Under the government, criminals slated for deportation have disappeared, illegal guns continue to cross our borders and the fentanyl crisis is devastating communities across the country, including in my own community of Oshawa. If we were to walk through downtown Oshawa, we would see the toll this crisis has taken: lives lost, families shattered, and neighbourhoods struggling under the weight of addiction and fear.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925133">Our first responders, outreach workers and volunteers are doing their best, but they are overwhelmed. According to Health Canada, more than 49,000 Canadians have died from apparent opioid toxicity since 2016, an entire community worth of lives. From January to June 2024 alone, 79% of accidental opioid deaths involve fentanyl, nearly double the proportion from 2016. Six months ago, my nephew, Cody Kirkland, died from an accidental overdose. Fentanyl and its precursors are the reason for that.</ParaText>

With October 19 to 24 being Small Business Week here in Canada, I am reminded this week and every day of just how much small businesses in my riding of Bay of Quinte provide to our local communities. This week is about recognizing the hard work, creativity and resilience of small businesses, especially through these challenging times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925173"> Small Business Week is also a moment to reflect on the challenges ahead and to recommit to supporting every entrepreneur with the tools they need to thrive. Our government stands with them, ensuring they have the opportunities and tools to shape Canada's future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925174"> I look forward to honouring some of these businesses at the Quinte Business Achievement Awards this coming Friday, where many local small business champions will be recognized. I thank all small businesses in Canada and those in the Bay of Quinte.</ParaText>

This decision raises serious questions about long-standing private property rights in British Columbia. People want to know if their land titles are secure and what this means for their homes and their future, yet the Liberal government has remained silent. There has been no explanation, no reassurance and no plan. As a result, Richmond is holding a public information session on October 28 so residents can get the answers the federal government has failed to provide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925176">Property ownership is a foundational Canadian right. It is not optional; it is the responsibility of the federal government to protect it. Canadians are watching. They expect the government to stand up for their rights, not stand by in silence.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925182">The AG reported that the CRA answered just 33% of the 32 million calls it got last year. That 33% is not a service level; it is a batting average. Perhaps the Blue Jays should hire the CRA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925183">When a call was answered, 83% of the responses given by the CRA were incorrect, which is less accuracy than a Liberal budget projection. Here is the kicker: Call centre employees do not even have to worry about giving wrong answers. In performance reviews, the CRA ranks showing up for work and going on coffee breaks as having a higher importance than delivering proper responses to taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925184">The CRA cannot answer phones, but it has increased the number of audits it is doing on Canadians by 10%. This is not a public service; it is a disservice to Canadians. After 10 years of Liberal mismanagement, Canadians deserve better.</ParaText>

I know folks in my community and folks across the country recognize how important this fentanyl crisis is and what is going on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925403">I hope the Liberals across the way will pay attention to this. I hope they will not have to have a crisis or a tragedy in their own families before they realize just how bad it is across the country. Police have uncovered superlabs operating right here in Canada, synthesizing fentanyl from precursor chemicals imported from China. Last fall, RCMP officers dismantled the largest and most sophisticated drug lab in Canadian history, capable of producing multiple kilograms of fentanyl each week, along with caches of loaded firearms, explosives and half a million dollars in cash.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925404">This is the reality. Fentanyl is not just a drug problem; it is a public safety and national security crisis fuelled by organized crime and enabled by weak borders. It is a humanity problem, yet Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is silent on the tools police and prosecutors actually need. There are still no new mandatory prison sentences for fentanyl traffickers. There are still no tougher penalties for gangsters who use guns to commit crimes, and the Liberals still allow house arrest for serious offences that endanger lives. Research and experience have shown that clear, consistent sentencing, including targeting mandatory minimums, deters repeat offenders and restores public confidence in justice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925405">We can already anticipate that the Liberals will soon stand and claim they are bringing forward new bail reform legislation, but Canadians remember the Liberal bail reform they already brought in through Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, instructing judges to release offenders at the earliest opportunity and under the least onerous conditions. In practice, it became a green light for repeat violent offenders to cycle in and out of the system, with tragic results in communities across Canada. Canadians do not need more Liberal announcements about bail. They need consequences that mean something and a justice system that protects victims and stops protecting repeat violent offenders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925406">We have a border system that cannot enforce removals and an immigration system so backlogged it invites abuse. We have a justice system that treats violent offenders as victims while law-abiding citizens face more restrictions than ever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925407">Conservatives believe in secure borders, a fair and orderly immigration system and a justice system that protects Canadians before it protects criminals. We believe Canada should continue to welcome those fleeing genuine persecution, but compassion must be paired with order, fairness and the rule of law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925408">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> may contain measures worth exploring, but Canadians cannot take the government's assurances at face value anymore. The privacy risks are serious, the enforcement gaps are dangerous, and the Liberal record demands skepticism, not blind trust. That is why Conservatives will carefully review the legislation, line by line and clause by clause, to ensure that it strengthens our borders, upholds privacy and defends public safety.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925427">Mr. Speaker, I rise today, as the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, to talk about the strengthening Canada's immigration system and borders act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925428">Our immigration system is one of our greatest strengths. It fuels our economy, builds our communities and reflects who we are as a country. As patterns of global migration evolve, our system must also evolve. Our government is committed to managing migration in a way that is safe, orderly and fair so that Canadians and those seeking to come here can have confidence in our immigration system. For the next few minutes, I will be speaking about the four provisions that deal with my department in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925429">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would strengthen Canada's immigration and border system. It would introduce new authorities to improve information sharing with federal, provincial and territorial partners. It would enhance how immigration documents are managed and would support a sustainable asylum system that upholds integrity, restores balance and strengthens public trust, both among Canadians and among those seeking to come to Canada. The bill would also strengthen the flexibility, efficiency and responsiveness of the asylum system by establishing new ineligibility rules, creating a more streamlined application process and focusing Canada's protection on those who need it the most.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8925430"> As a former provincial minister of immigration, I know how essential it is for the federal, provincial and territorial governments to work together on immigration policies and programs. When I was minister of immigration in Nova Scotia, I saw first-hand how strong partnerships help meet the needs of employers and communities, while supporting diversity and growth. The information shared by the federal government helps provinces and territories plan their programs and services more effectively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925431">That is why I am particularly proud that the bill makes it easier to share information on immigration, citizenship and passports with our national partners. This will enable us to improve the integrity of government programs and deliver better customer service.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925432">As we improve how information is shared, we also must modernize the asylum system to strengthen migration integrity. To protect the system from sudden surges in claims, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would introduce new ineligibility rules for asylum. These measures make it clear that asylum is not a shortcut to permanent immigration. They would reduce pressure on the system so that protection can be provided more efficiently to those who truly need it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925433">Under the legislation, the federal government would no longer refer claims to the Immigration and Refugee Board for a decision if claims are made more than a year after someone first arrives after June 24, 2020, or if claims are made 14 or more days after someone enters Canada from the U.S. between official border crossings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925434">History shows us that most asylum claims are made within the first year of arrival. In the majority of cases, one year gives claimants time to consult experts, gather documents and make an informed decision. The one-year limit discourages those wanting to use the asylum system to extend their stay in Canada if other mechanisms fail. Canada is a generous country that values fairness, but not for those who try to bypass our laws and systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925435">The same principle applies to those who cross the border between ports of entry. Despite clear laws and repeated warnings, some still attempt to enter Canada from the U.S. without checking in at an official land border office. It is dangerous, it is not legal and it is not safe. There have been many tragic cases of injury and loss of life. Such routes are often linked to human smuggling and organized crime, placing individuals, often travelling with children, at even greater risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925436">If someone wants to come to Canada, the message is clear: They should use our existing lawful programs and pathways. Through federal, provincial and territorial streams, they are welcome to apply.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925437">Claims filed more than a year after claimants first arrive, starting on June 24, 2020, and those filed 14 days or more after an irregular entry would not be referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board for a decision. Those whose claims are found ineligible would be referred to the removal process, with access to a pre-removal risk assessment. Let me be clear. Those who have well-founded fears of returning to their country of origin would have access to protection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925438">As part of Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, our government is introducing legislation to better manage immigration documents and applications, improving efficiency and reinforcing the integrity of Canada's immigration system. This legislation would give our government greater flexibility to manage immigration documents and applications. It would allow us to respond quickly and responsibly in times of crisis or uncertainty, while continuing to uphold strong safeguards that protect people's rights and ensure due process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925439">Canada's immigration system must be able to adapt to global realities and global pressures. Conflict, climate and political instability can all influence and have all influenced migration flows, and our system needs the tools to respond responsibly and effectively.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925440">This bill supports Canada's broader efforts to strengthen the integrity of our immigration system by giving the government the tools it needs to respond quickly and effectively to global challenges while maintaining fairness and transparency.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925444">That authority, however, does not apply to groups of immigration documents. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would give Canada the ability to suspend, change or cancel multiple documents in exceptional circumstances. For example, it could be used during a global health or security crisis, with appropriate safeguards in place to protect people's rights and due process. It would also strengthen the government's ability to pause the intake of new applications when necessary. These authorities would allow the government to act swiftly and responsibly in the public interest, protecting against safety and security threats, health risks or abuse of publicly funded programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925445">Let me be clear that this bill does not authorize the automatic cancellation of immigration documents, nor does it affect asylum claims or immigration status. Any use of these authorities would follow a separate evidence-based process and require a decision by the Governor in Council.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925446">In conclusion, these changes reflect the reality that we are living in in today's changing world.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8925467">Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to be here today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>. The bill proposes amendments to various acts that would make our laws even stronger and that would keep our families, children and communities safe while protecting privacy and charter rights. The bill would help the government fight the flow of illegal fentanyl, enhance the integrity of our immigration and asylum systems, and combat money laundering. The focus of my speech today will be with respect to parts 2, 3 and 4 of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925468">I will begin by stating that I do not think there is any member of the House without stories about how their communities have been touched by the fentanyl overdose crisis, the flow of precursors and the significant impact those have on families and communities across the country. According to Health Canada, in 2022 an average of 21 lives were lost each day because of opioid-related overdoses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925469">Part 4 of the bill would amend the Canada Post Corporation Act to enable police to search the mail as part of a criminal investigation. The amendments would remove a legal barrier to otherwise lawful seizure of mail, but would not create new search and seizure authorities. With this change, law enforcement could rely on existing search and seizure provisions in federal legislation, which is most commonly a search warrant issued under the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925470">The need for judicial pre-authorization would ensure that mail seizures are conducted in accordance with the law and the charter. This would bring Canada Post into alignment with other courier and parcel delivery service providers such as Purolator that are already subject to lawful search and seizure. The bill would also expand inspection powers for postal inspectors. These changes would enable the police to stop the mail service from being used to traffic drugs and other illegal materials.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925471">With the measures in the bill, we would be in a stronger position to prevent dangerous drugs such as fentanyl and their precursor chemicals from finding their way onto our streets and into our communities, to keep Canadians safe. Right now, police officers are not allowed to search and seize letter mail as part of an investigation, not even with a warrant; as a result, fentanyl and other synthetic opioids can be easily trafficked in small amounts by drug traffickers exploiting the postal system by sending illicit drugs through this method. The amendments to the act outlined in part 4 of Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> become crucial to correcting the issue and stopping the flow of illegal drugs into our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925472">The amendments to the Canada Post Corporation Act would allow police to search and seize contraband, including fentanyl, from Canada Post mail with a warrant. If I may, I will repeat, “with a warrant”, because I have heard many times a lot of misinformation coming from the other side of the House. Police could not just open our mail; they would be required to obtain a warrant from a judge to lawfully search and seize letter mail during an investigation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925473">The provisions would bring Canada Post in line with other mail couriers such as FedEx and Purolator.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925474"> The change would, notably, help remote indigenous communities and rural municipalities in their efforts to intercept dangerous illegal drugs such as fentanyl, which is often delivered through the mail via Canada Post. The <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> has heard from these communities, and they are supporting the measures. ln fact, they have been calling on us to do this. The Mushkegowuk Council stated that the government's proposed amendments to the Canada Post Corporation Act are a good first step in addressing current enforcement gaps.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925475">We also need to address the flow of chemicals used to produce fentanyl. Criminal groups mislabel precursors used to produce fentanyl to smuggle them into the country. Often these chemicals enter Canada legally to support the production of legal goods. To disrupt the flow of illegal fentanyl, the bill would create a new accelerated scheduling pathway to make it easier for the Minister of Health to order limits on precursor chemicals to ensure that they are used legitimately.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>

              <ParaText id="8925490">Mr. Speaker, if we are going to talk about this piece of legislation, we should put a couple of things into context.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925491">The first thing I would put into context is that this is another bill the Liberals are trying to bring forward to allegedly do something to deal with the massive surge in crime that has gone on in Canada over the last 10 years. It is a remarkable turnaround. I still recall when former minister of justice Arif Virani sat in this chamber. He would get up in question period and say we were trying to scare Canadians and were engaging in typical Conservative fear on the issue of crime when we raised the staggering increase in crime and violent crime. That was his answer. Now it seems like the Liberals have had their reckoning and realized that over the last 10 years, due to their policies, we have had a massive surge in crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925492">If members do not want to take my word for it, I have a few statistics that I would like to go through so that Canadians can understand just how bad crime has gotten. in this country under the Liberal government. Total violent crime is up 49.84%. Let us round that up to 50%. There has been a 50% increase in violent crime after a decade of the Liberals running the country. Homicide is up 28%. Gang-related homicide is up 78%. Sexual assault is up 74%. Extortion is up 357%. Let that sink in for a moment. A decade ago, we had a certain amount of extortion and it is now up 357%. We know the terrible things that happen when people are trafficking in persons. That is up 83%. All of this has happened over the last decade with the Liberals running the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925493"> They introduced a massive omnibus bill, Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>. To get to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, we have to talk a little about Bill C-2. I am old enough to remember when the Liberals used to say it was a terrible thing to introduce omnibus pieces of legislation, and they would never do such things, but here we are. Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> was going to amend 15 statutes and had 120 pages of technical statutory changes. As Conservatives, we said, “That is a no go.” In fact, it is due to Conservative pressure, because of a number of things that were included in Bill C-2, that we ended up here with Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, which actually has some things that we think might do some good. I know it is a strange thing to say, but as they often say, a broken clock is right twice a day, so they may have gotten a couple of things right in Bill C-12.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925494">To go back to Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, I really want to talk about some very deeply troubling things that were included in that piece of legislation. It shows the mindset of the Liberals, who have turned around on some of these issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925495">One of these is how Canada Post would be able to search mail. In and of itself, it is problematic, but the statutory change the Liberals were trying to bring in said this could happen with reasonable suspicion. Bill C-2 reads, “reasonable grounds to suspect”. That is the lowest threshold in law that could be used to do this. Normally, to be able to search something, we need the much higher standard of “reasonable grounds to believe”. The Liberals were putting in the very lowest standard possible of reasonable suspicion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925496"> Because this was about the corporation, it would mean that any employee of the corporation who had a reasonable suspicion could be opening mail. It is a particularly troubling standard that they were trying to put into the bill. It has been through hard work from the Conservatives, who said “absolutely not”, that those parts of the legislation remain in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> and are not included in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8925497">It is also very interesting to note what is not included in any of these pieces of legislation which is trying to deal with the issue of crime that the Liberals are belatedly waking up to. For example, there is nothing in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> that would deal with the issues of fentanyl trafficking and sentencing for fentanyl traffickers. Something like that could have been incorporated into it to crack down on fentanyl trafficking. We believe it needs to be done, but it is not in there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925498">The Liberals also did not take the time to eliminate, for example, house arrest for drive-by shootings, which is still okay. They put together a massive omnibus piece of legislation, in part to deal with crime, but they left things like that out of it. It is available, so somebody engaging in a drive-by shooting is eligible for house arrest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925499">If we go back to the statistics I talked about, gang-related homicide is up 78%. Generally speaking, the kinds of people who are engaging in drive-by shootings are people in gangs trying to cause homicides. The Liberals had so much opportunity to do better, and they failed on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925500">Another thing they failed to do is make it crystal clear that so-called safe consumption sites should not be allowed anywhere near schools. We know the effects of these safe consumption sites. They become a blight in a neighbourhood, and having them near schools and children is not the kind of thing we want. Again, this was a simple place for the Liberals to have made that change, and they chose not to.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925501">Let us quickly switch and talk a bit about some of the changes to immigration. I was around when Stephen Harper was prime minister and changes were made to the asylum system, and we brought asylum claims down to about 10,000. It sounds like a lot, but it is 10,000. If we look at where things are now, again, after a decade of these Liberals and their absolute and utter mismanagement of the immigration system, asylum claims are now at a whopping 296,000. Think about that. A decade ago, they were at 10,000, and now they are at 296,000. I think the estimate to process these 296,000 cases in the backlog is 25 years. Let that sink in. That is the backlog on asylum claims that has been created by the Liberals' absolute mismanagement of the immigration system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925502">What we are now hearing from some experts is that the proposed changes would not fix the broken system. This problem would be transferred to the courts, because they have decided they cannot fix it. The fix is not to figure out a way to quickly process the backlog, because we know so many of these claims are bogus asylum claims. In fact, one of the things we did under Prime Minister Harper was try to eliminate bogus asylum claims from certain countries by imposing visa requirements. One of the first things the Liberals did was eliminate those visa requirements. Surprise, surprise, we are up to 296,000.</ParaText>

The member who spends all day, every day doing nothing but talk about how great he thinks the government is doing is now laughing as I talk about the seriousness of a 296,000-person backlog. The system is absolutely broken after 10 years of the Liberals' management of the system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925505">There may be some things in this legislation that we could support. We have to send it to committee. I want to commend all of my colleagues for their hard work in getting this bill broken up into parts so that some of the things we know we cannot support are going to be in one particular piece of legislation, and some of the things we think we might be able to support with a bit of study are going to be in this particular piece of legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925506">I look forward to this particular piece of legislation being studied at committee.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925531">Bill C‑12 will make our borders even stronger. The bill amends the Customs Act to strengthen the CBSA's powers. The CBSA will now be able to better monitor points of entry and exit and to require owners and operators to provide the necessary facilities to facilitate inspections. Border officers will also have access to places under the control of carriers and warehouse operators to examine goods destined for export, so they will be able to intercept stolen or illicit goods leaving the country. This will make it possible to intercept more drugs, guns and stolen vehicles before they leave Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925532">The bill also modernizes the Oceans Act to expand the Canadian Coast Guard's mandate, allowing it to conduct security patrols and to share essential intelligence. This will strengthen maritime surveillance, which is critical to our national security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925533">The RCMP's capacities will also be strengthened, particularly for sharing information on registered sex offenders with domestic and international partners. Such information sharing is fundamental to protecting communities all across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925534">At the same time, Bill C‑12 proposes rules aimed at safeguarding the integrity of our immigration system. It includes measures to better manage asylum claims and introduces inadmissibility grounds that will help prevent abuse while upholding fundamental humanitarian principles in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925535">It is also important to understand that this bill complements our other measures to strengthen our borders, including Canada's border plan, which comes with $1.3 billion in funding, the largest investment in border security in Canadian history.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925536"> When we talk about strengthening our country's security, it is not just talk. We are taking concrete action. In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> recently announced new measures that will appear in the upcoming budget. We are going to hire 1,000 new CBSA officers. These new officers will help crack down on the movement of stolen goods and drugs, enforce import measures and investigate unfair trade practices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925537">We are also going to increase the CBSA's recruit stipend for the first time since 2005, raising it from $125 to $525 per week, to help attract and retain the next generation of highly trained border officers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925538">We are also going to amend the Public Service Superannuation Act to ensure that officers and other frontline first responders receive benefits that reflect the weight of their responsibilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925539">This is terrific news, not only for my riding, which contains several border crossings, but for our country as a whole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925540">I would now like to turn to the second pillar of Bill C‑12, namely combatting transnational organized crime and fentanyl. Now more than ever, the threat posed by transnational organized crime is a reality we must face. We understand that a strong Canada requires strong crime fighting measures.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925541">The opioid crisis is wreaking havoc across the country. Thousands of lives are being lost every year. Not a day goes by without hearing heartbreaking stories of lives cut short. We cannot remain indifferent in the face of such a crisis, and we must take action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925542">Bill C‑12 introduces a temporary accelerated scheduling pathway that will allow the Minister of Health to quickly control the precursor chemicals used to manufacture illicit drugs. This measure will enable law enforcement agencies and the CBSA to act swiftly to prevent these substances from being imported and used illegally, while ensuring rigorous oversight of their legitimate use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925543">The bill also strengthens the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing through tougher penalties and improved supervisory collaboration between the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada and the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee. This enhanced collaboration is essential to detecting and stopping illicit financial transactions that fuel crime and terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925544">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C‑12</Document> is part of a series of bold and decisive public safety measures that our new government has been taking since the beginning of our mandate. We know that safe, resilient communities are the backbone of a strong Canada. They attract people, families, businesses and investment and enable greater certainty and prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925545">Just last week, our government announced new measures that will protect Canadians and keep our communities safe. We will strengthen Canada's Criminal Code to keep violent and repeat offenders out of our communities, including those accused of serious crimes such as violent auto theft, breaking and entering, human trafficking, violent assault and sexual assault.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925546">We will also introduce consecutive sentencing to ensure that multiple crimes mean more time behind bars, impose harsher penalties for organized retail theft and restrict conditional sentences for a number of sexual offences. These are changes the public wants to see. We are also planning to hire an additional 1,000 RCMP personnel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925547">In the 2025 budget that will be tabled in the House on November 4, we will be announcing a $1.8‑billion investment over four years to increase federal policing capacity across Canada to combat crime, including online fraud, money laundering, online child sexual exploitation, and organized criminal networks that threaten Canada's economic and national security. This funding will also go toward raising the RCMP cadet recruitment allowance to $1,000 per week and dedicating 150 new RCMP personnel to tackle financial crimes, targeting money laundering networks, organized crime, online fraud and the recovery of illicit assets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925548">Yesterday, the <Affiliation DbId="318631" Type="4">Minister of Finance and National Revenue</Affiliation> also announced that we are going to introduce the very first national anti-fraud strategy and a new anti-fraud agency. These concrete measures will help protect Canadians, especially seniors and vulnerable persons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925549">Our actions show that we are very serious about the mandate given to us by Canadians to make our communities safer and our borders more secure. That is why we are taking a holistic approach, as I just mentioned. Through historic investments, bold action and tough legislation, such as Bill C‑12, Canada's new government is working to protect our way of life. We are fighting crime, building safer communities and ensuring that Canadians have the security that they deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925550">Bill C‑12 is the result of careful consideration, is backed by a massive investment and is designed to protect Canadians while respecting fundamental rights. Securing our borders and keeping Canadians safe means ensuring that the government and law enforcement have the tools they need to do their jobs. We have a collective responsibility to work toward a safer and stronger Canada. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C‑12</Document> is a decisive step in that direction, and we are confident that it will meet Canadians' expectations.</ParaText>

The government has announced the hiring of 1,000 officers, but it did not specify when that would happen.

              <ParaText id="8925568">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, legislation the Liberal government claims will strengthen our borders and protect our immigration system, but when examined closely, this bill is not about proactive security, it is about political damage control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925569">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is not a fresh start. It is a rebranded version of Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, legislation the government withdrew after Canadians were outraged by its sweeping powers to access personal digital data without a warrant. Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> would have allowed authorities to obtain Canadians' communications from phone companies, dating apps and even mental health platforms, with no judge, no oversight and no accountability. Conservatives said no. We believe in strong border security and effective enforcement, but never at the expense of Canadians' fundamental freedoms. Security and privacy are not competing objectives. In a democracy, they must coexist.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925570">The government removed the most invasive powers from Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> only because it was exposed, not because it understood the threat to Canadians' rights. The <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> has openly stated that those powers are still being pursued. The RCMP commissioner confirmed they are working with the minister to bring them back. Canadians' privacy has not been safeguarded, as this has merely been postponed. We must remain vigilant because the government has shown a willingness to reintroduce these measures quietly when public attention shifts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925571">While seeking new powers, the government has failed to deliver on basic enforcement. It promised to hire 1,000 new CBSA officers. That promise was broken. At major border crossings, such as the Pacific Highway and Douglas port near Vancouver, officers are stretched thin, trying to stop sophisticated smuggling operations with inadequate staffing and outdated resources. Organized crime is exploiting these enforcement gaps right now, yet Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> contains no staffing commitments, no new resources and no operational enhancements. lt does not address the real challenges facing our border agents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925572">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> amends 11 acts. Some of these measures are constructive and will assist law enforcement, for example, allowing CBSA to use private export facilities for inspections, enabling the <Affiliation DbId="318692" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> to quickly ban precursor chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl, allowing the Canadian Coast Guard to share security information with law enforcement and tightening safe third country rules so that illegal border crossers may be returned to the United States within 14 days if they do not qualify for asylum. These are constructive elements. Conservatives support targeted reforms that improve enforcement and close gaps in coordination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925573">However, these improvements are overshadowed by sweeping new powers the bill grants to the minister, powers that lack clear safeguards, transparency or due process. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would allow the minister to unilaterally cancel immigration documents based on allegations of fraud or criminality without defined criteria or independent oversight. Canadians expect fairness, transparency and accountability, not political discretion that could undermine the integrity of our immigration system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925574"> In Richmond Centre—Marpole, residents are deeply concerned about the pressures on housing, health care and public safety. They support legal immigration and strong enforcement, not a system where ministerial power replaces due process.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8925575">More than 50,000 Canadians have died from opioid toxicity since 2016, and nearly 80% of those deaths involved fentanyl. Police have dismantled superlabs in Langley, Falkland and Richmond capable of producing kilograms of fentanyl every week. Just two milligrams, a few grains of salt, can kill a person. This is not recreational drug use. It is deliberate mass poisoning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925576">Conservatives believe that, if someone is manufacturing or trafficking fentanyl in lethal quantities, they are knowingly causing death and should face a mandatory life sentence. We have tabled targeted proposals to ensure major traffickers, importers and producers face real prison time, yet Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is silent. There would be new offences, no new mandatory penalties and no enhanced enforcement measures for cross-border traffickers. While Canadians are losing their loved ones every day, the government refuses to act. We cannot accept a justice system that allows fentanyl traffickers to receive house arrest or suspended sentences. Conservatives will continue to fight for real consequences to protect Canadians and save lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925577">To be effective, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> must be strengthened. Conservatives are calling for mandatory life sentences for major fentanyl traffickers, real resources and staffing for CBSA to enforce our laws, strong privacy protections with independent judicial oversight and mandatory public reporting for any future orders affecting privacy or mobility rights. Canadians deserve legislation that delivers security with transparency and accountability, not legislation written to manage headlines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925578">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> reflects a pattern we have seen repeatedly from the government, which is to introduce sweeping and vague legislation, face public push-back, retreat temporarily and then attempt to reintroduce the same measures under a different name. That is not leadership. It is governance by reaction, not reflection. Canadians expect responsible, balanced legislation that protects both public safety and constitutional freedoms. Conservatives reject the government's approach of overreach first and correction later. We believe law must be grounded in principle, built through consultation, and transparent in application.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925579">Conservatives believe in strong borders, safe communities and an immigration system that is both fair and firm, one that welcomes those who follow the rules and holds accountable those who do not. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> may have removed the most extreme intrusions, but it still reflects the same pattern: overreach, retreat and repackaging. The bill would fail to address the fentanyl crisis, would fail to fix enforcement gaps and would fail to protect Canadians' privacy rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925580">We will continue to stand up for the safety and freedoms of Canadians, defend the integrity of our immigration system and fight the scourge of fentanyl with the seriousness it demands. Canada can have security without surveillance and compassion without chaos. That is balance and that is common sense. That is what Conservatives would deliver.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925596">Mr. Speaker, a border is not just a line on a map. It is a symbol of our security, our sovereignty and our ability to make our own decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925597">For 10 years, the federal government has been turning a blind eye while stolen vehicles leave our ports, fentanyl crosses our borders and Quebec alone bears the brunt of unprecedented migratory pressure. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925598">Today Ottawa is taking action, but only because it no longer has a choice. During all that time, the Bloc Québécois has been calling for better border control and increased efforts to combat organized crime and drug trafficking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925599">To us and the Government of Quebec, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is a step in the right direction. However, let us be clear: Our support is not a carte blanche endorsement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925600">Before praising the bill, we must also recognize its limitations. This bill incorporates several measures already included in <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">Bill C-2</Document>, which is intended to combat transnational organized crime. Rather than piling up more legislation, the government would do better to enforce existing laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925601">I would like to remind the House that the government's border security promises are not new. On April 10, 2025, in the midst of the election campaign, the Liberal leader, the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that is, proudly announced in Brampton that his government would hire 1,000 RCMP officers and another 1,000 CBSA officers in order to curb the flow of migrants and combat fentanyl trafficking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925602">Six months later, on October 17, the same Prime Minister repeated the same announcement word for word, this time presenting it as a bold new measure. The same numbers, the same promise, the same speech—in short, nothing new at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925603">If anyone is looking for concrete proof of the disparity between words and actions, they need only think of Roxham Road, a symbol of the Liberals' failure to control our borders. Between 2017 and 2023, more than 150,000 people crossed this border irregularly. In 2022 alone, there were nearly 40,000 crossings, more than all previous years combined. Of these irregular entries, nearly 90% were in Quebec. Quebec therefore bore the human, logistical and financial burden of this situation alone, spending more than $400 million on accommodation, services and support. Rather than taking action, Ottawa allowed the issue to fester, repeating that nothing could be done, until the pressure became untenable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925604">When the Bloc Québécois asked to renegotiate the safe third country agreement to close Roxham Road, the government responded with bureaucratic excuses. As a result, there have been six years of neglect and Quebec was left to fend for itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925605">This makeshift system where Quebec's role is to pay up while Ottawa communicates is a shining example of the federal government's denial. A border left open for six years is no border. It is an abdication of responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925606">Ottawa likes to talk about a strong Canada. However, a strong country is not built on press releases. It is built with staff, equipment and commitment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925607">Let us talk about staff. The customs union estimates that the Canada Border Services Agency currently needs another 2,000 to 3,000 officers to properly fulfill its mandate. The government keeps making announcements, but on the ground, positions remain vacant. Inspections are not being conducted at ports, and border regions are still awaiting reinforcements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925608">The government even promised to review the pension plans of frontline officers in recognition of the fact that their jobs are so difficult, but once again, there was no meaningful follow-up. Officers are still waiting for concrete action, not press releases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925609">The government may be proud of its promises, but what it is saying in press conferences does not match reality. Trust is built on action, not on mere intentions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925610">The Bloc Québécois, like the customs union, is asking that Ottawa authorize CBSA officers to patrol between border crossings. We are not talking about replacing the RCMP, but rather empowering CBSA officers to intervene on the ground in places where trafficking and illegal border crossings occur. Nothing is preventing the government from doing so, apart from its own inaction.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8925611">When containers filled with stolen vehicles leave our ports without undergoing any inspection, this is not an administrative detail. It is a loss of sovereignty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925612">The border is also a matter of economic sovereignty. When imported products are brought into the country in violation of trade rules, our producers and local businesses pay the price. The Bloc Québécois will support any measure that protects Quebec's security and economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925613">As the Bloc Québécois's science and innovation critic, I would also like to address the issue of asylum claims filed by some international students. For months now, universities have been sounding the alarm about the worrisome issue of fake students who enter Canada on a student visa, attend no classes and make an asylum claim after one year. These cases of fraud undermine the credibility of our university system and deny genuine talent a place at these institutions. In a system that limits the number of international students, every spot matters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925614">The most troubling thing about this is the way Ottawa has reacted. Instead of taking responsibility, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada is asking universities to police foreign students and to verify every student's attendance record and legitimacy. It seems to expect deans to act as immigration officers. Meanwhile, the same department is refusing to provide universities with data on individuals who filed a refugee claim after getting a study permit. In other words, Ottawa is asking universities to solve a problem without giving them the necessary information to do that. This inconsistency is irresponsible. The Bloc Québécois will not allow universities to become an administrative appendage of a department that is not doing its job. We are pleased that the bill seeks to close this loophole, but a lot more needs to be done to make Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada genuinely transparent and accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925615">This bureaucratic inconsistency is also clear from the way Ottawa administers the safe third country agreement. For too long, this agreement allowed anyone who entered irregularly outside an official point of entry to file an asylum claim if they were not intercepted within 14 days. This provision encouraged clandestine and sometimes hazardous crossings. The government partially closed this loophole, but it did so without negotiating with Washington, preferring a unilateral solution instead. Now, anyone intercepted after 14 days will be returned to their country of origin, unless it is a moratorium country. This is progress, but it is still incomplete.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925616">The Bloc Québécois will be monitoring the impact of this reform to ensure it does not create any new inconsistencies. We will also be scrutinizing the provisions that give new powers to the federal immigration minister, particularly the proposed addition to section 87 that would allow the minister to suspend, cancel or refuse to process visas, electronic travel authorizations or study permits. There is a legitimate objective for that, namely to combat fraud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925617">However, these powers must be circumscribed, especially if they impact permanent residents selected by Quebec. If there are no guardrails on this power, it could even invalidate decisions made under the Quebec experience program or other federal-provincial agreements. This would set a momentous precedent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925618">For years, Quebec has accepted a disproportionate number of asylum seekers, significantly in excess of its intake capacity. This situation has become untenable. The Bloc Québécois will ensure that Quebec's voice is heard, so that a fairer redistribution can be put in place and refugees can be accommodated in a way that respects Quebec's capacity and jurisdiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925619">At committee, we will propose that the public safety minister be required to table a public report each year on the resources and operations of the CBSA. Quebeckers have the right to know whether their border is really being protected. This debate highlights a broader issue. When Ottawa centralizes, Quebec waits. When Ottawa promises, Quebec must be patient. When Ottawa fails, it is Quebec that pays the price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925620"> To summarize, the Bloc Québécois will support Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> at second reading, but let us be clear: Our support is not a free pass.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925624">As I said in my speech, the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> repeated what he had said six months ago. Now we are being told that there will be money in the next budget on November 4. The Liberals cannot even tell us how many new officers they hired in the last six months.

              <ParaText id="8925628">I recently met with the union for the CBSA. The CBSA can maybe get 700 people per year through training. It loses between 500 and 600 people a year through attrition. Job satisfaction is extremely low, potentially the lowest in the government. The max number of people it can get through training per year is 200. Furthermore, since there is no budget, when it comes to police, anybody who is doing an acting job cannot get paid, so delaying the budget has real consequences.</ParaText>

Then there is fentanyl. Again, this requires coordination and mobilizing resources, not just good intentions. I hope the government will get to work as soon as possible. It needs to hire officers, but also ensure coordination, with a coordinated strategic plan.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925643">While the government keeps coming out with more and more announcements and slogans, communities are feeling the direct pressure of these poorly planned policies. Canadians, the people of Beauce, families and business owners are all saying the same thing: The Liberal government has lost control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925644"> My colleague will be pleased to hear me say that Roxham Road became the symbol of this loss of control. It was wide open. Tens of thousands of people entered Canada illegally in plain sight. Everyone saw that. There was no security and no proper screening. What did the government do? It did absolutely nothing. It allowed things to get worse, weakening our immigration system and eroding public trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925645">Let us be clear, there is a difference between legitimate refugees fleeing war and persecution and illegal migrants circumventing the law. The situation is also very different when it comes to economic workers, who are desperately needed in certain regions of Canada. The Liberal government created and maintained this confusion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925646">Meanwhile, the consequences are very real: We have a housing shortage, skyrocketing rents and overburdened public services. This is not ideology; it is a simple mathematical reality. When hundreds of thousands of people arrive without a plan to accommodate them and without enough housing, rents go up. It is simple math. That is fundamental. It is simple. Everyone saw it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925647">Bill C-12 claims to strengthen the security and integrity of the system, but once again, it is superficial. There need to be more resources, fewer announcements and some decisive action. The government needs to implement effective mechanisms to deport criminals and improve border surveillance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925648">While the government dwells on processes, criminals are getting organized. Drug traffickers, arms smugglers and groups associated with cartels are taking advantage of these government loopholes. As we said earlier, the border is really porous. Our borders have become a vulnerable point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925649">Canada needs a clear plan, well-monitored borders and rigorous screening at entry and exit points. Our border officers and police officers need more support. Most importantly, there needs to be the political will to act. Bill C‑12 is weak on crime, weak on gangs and too weak to address what is actually happening on the ground. Again, I am talking about the reality on the ground.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925650">Beyond immigration, another crucial issue for the safety of Canadians is the reform of the bail system. Too often, individuals accused of serious crimes are being released without sufficient safeguards, which endangers the public and undermines confidence in our justice system.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8925651">The Liberal government has failed to take decisive action on this issue, favouring measures that prioritize the rights of alleged offenders over the safety of victims and citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925652">It is essential that Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> or any other reform include more rigorous mechanisms for denying bail to individuals who pose a real risk to society. We must strengthen the role of judges so that they have the tools they need to protect Canadians, taking into account not only the presumption of innocence, but also the paramount importance of public safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925653">Furthermore, protecting the fundamental rights of Canadians must remain an unwavering priority in any legislative reform. A responsible government must be able to rigorously defend these rights, while ensuring social peace and the rule of law. This is how Canada will maintain its status as a free and orderly society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925654">A poorly monitored border is an open door to illegal activities such as arms and drug trafficking or illegal immigration. Our border officers do an excellent job, but they simply lack resources. Again, the government is only making announcements. It is not taking action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925655">It is important to remember that some regions, like Beauce, share a direct border with the United States, in my case, with the state of Maine. This geographic reality demands greater vigilance. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> does not propose any measures to better protect these sensitive areas. It completely ignores the unique challenges specific to border regions. This is a serious flaw in an already fragile system. Canadians deserve better. They deserve a government that protects them, takes action and stands up for the integrity of our country. The safety of Canadians must always come first. We have seen the consequences when that is not the case: exploitation, fraud, crime. A responsible government does not throw open its doors without ensuring that those who enter share our values, respect our laws and contribute to our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925656">Demanding rigour does not mean one is against immigration. We support a system that is fair, orderly and respected. The Conservative Party believes that we can welcome people with compassion, but also with caution and judiciousness. It is a matter of respect for Canadians and for newcomers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925657">Meanwhile, the Liberals are inflating immigration thresholds without taking the reality on the ground into account. The housing crisis is getting worse. Inflation is driving up housing prices. Millions of Canadians, including people in Beauce, are struggling to find housing. Rents are skyrocketing. Mortgages are drifting out of reach. There is no coordination with cities or provinces to adapt infrastructure, hospitals, schools or housing. That is irresponsible. In many regions, including Beauce, businesses are desperately looking for skilled workers. The current federal system is failing employers. They have to navigate a complicated and lengthy bureaucratic maze while highly skilled foreign workers wait in limbo.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925658"> Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C‑12</Document> is a step in the right direction, but it does not solve anything. It does not align immigration with actual economic needs. It overlooks rural and industrial regions. It does not support businesses, families or local growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925659">Another essential element is that the provinces have been excluded from the planning. There is no coordination, no serious dialogue. However, they are the ones that must provide education, health care and housing services. As a result, schools are overwhelmed, hospitals are overflowing and there is not enough housing. Ottawa makes all the decisions but then always blames everybody else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925660">The Conservative Party is proposing a different path, an approach based on collaboration, listening, and shared responsibility. Provinces and municipalities have to have a say, because they are close to the reality and know their limitations. Immigration cannot be simply a matter of quotas. It also needs to take integration, social cohesion and shared values into account. That is what we, as Conservatives, promise to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925686"> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the strengthening Canada's immigration system and borders act, a piece of legislation the Liberals have hastily introduced in the wake of Conservative opposition to their previous omnibus bill, Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925687">Before addressing Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> directly, it is essential to reflect on the deeply flawed Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>. This omnibus bill, which sprawls across 140 pages and would amend over a dozen pieces of legislation, was a dangerous attempt by the Liberals to consolidate sweeping powers that would trample on Canadians' fundamental rights and freedoms. The bill was so broad and so intrusive that it sparked serious concern not only from Conservatives, but from legal experts, privacy advocates, opposition parties and of course everyday Canadians. At my office, we received numerous calls and have had numerous correspondence with constituents who are deeply concerned with the provisions of Bill C-2, which I will detail later in my speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925688">The Conservatives played a pivotal role in pushing the government back from its original overreach in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>. Part 4 of Bill C-2, for example, would have allowed Canada Post to open any mail without a warrant, which is a flagrant violation of privacy in a country that prides itself on liberal democratic values. Thankfully, this part has been stripped from Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, though it is still in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, which remains before Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925689">Similarly, Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> included sweeping warrantless powers for the government to demand personal data from electronic service providers, banks and telecommunications companies, which was done under parts 14, 15 and 16. These powers would have allowed the government to collect detailed location and subscriber information without judicial oversight, disregarding basic principles of privacy and due process. The Privacy Commissioner himself confirmed that the government had failed to consult him before pushing these alarming measures, which is a stark reminder of how little regard the Liberals have for Canadians' privacy rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925690">The clauses within Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> were sharply criticized for threatening personal privacy and potentially breaching the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, including section 15, the right to be treated equally under the law. This is according to an analysis by the Library of Parliament. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925691">Matt Hatfield, the executive director of the advocacy group OpenMedia, said, per The Globe and Mail:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925692">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...the proposal could compel a large range of electronic service providers, including social media platforms, e-mail and messaging services, gaming platforms, telecoms and cloud storage companies, to disclose information about their subscribers including the province and local area where they use their services without judicial oversight.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925693">This is not the Canada that Canadians expect. Law-abiding citizens deserve privacy protections, not to be treated as collateral damage in a government's quest to expand its control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925694">Again, the Conservatives have been proud to stand firm and force the government to remove these unjustified intrusions from Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>. That is the duty of a principled opposition: to safeguard Canadians' freedoms and hold the government accountable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925695">While Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is an improvement and is something that the Conservatives plan to support and send to committee for further study, it does remain incomplete. One glaring failure of Bill C-12 is that the Liberal government still refuses to take seriously the fentanyl crisis, a crisis ravaging Canadian families, devastating communities and destroying lives across this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925696">Let me remind the House of the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s own words earlier this year, when he dismissed the fentanyl crisis as merely a “challenge” in Canada, while calling it a “crisis” in the United States. Such minimization is not only out of touch, but deeply irresponsible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925697">Health Canada reports that fentanyl was involved in 79% of opioid-related deaths in the first half of 2024, a staggering increase over previous years. Despite this crisis, the Liberals continue to push for drug consumption sites near schools. At the health committee, the Conservatives called for the Liberals to shut down fentanyl consumption sites next to children, but the <Affiliation DbId="318692" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> refused to rule out approving more of these consumption sites next to schools and day cares.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8925698">Canadian police have uncovered and dismantled superlabs manufacturing kilograms of this lethal drug within our borders, fuelling a national emergency that the government continues to downplay. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> fails to implement mandatory minimum sentencing for fentanyl traffickers, the very criminals who are poisoning our streets and fuelling the opioid epidemic. The Liberals continue to resist measures that would ensure traffickers face serious consequences for flooding our streets with this extremely lethal poison.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925699">The Liberal government claims to be tough on crime. We have heard the <Affiliation DbId="318708" Type="5">Secretary of State for Combatting Crime</Affiliation> say this very thing, yet people of my riding of Vaughan-Woodbridge and across this country see it very differently. They see a much different reality, one marked by rising shootings, brazen bank robberies and increasing violent crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925700">The Liberals continue to refuse to close the loopholes that allow catch-and-release bail for fentanyl dealers and firearms traffickers, loopholes that criminal gangs exploit to terrorize our communities. The Liberal government has had ample opportunity to address the seriousness of crime affecting our country. Since they have taken power, violent crime is up 50% and violent firearms offences are up 116%, increasing for nine straight years. Auto theft, which is a huge issue in Vaughan, is up 46% nationally. Everyone in my community knows someone who knows someone who has had their vehicle either stolen or attempted to be stolen. Gang related homicides are also up 78%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925701">The Conservatives unequivocally believe that trafficking lethal fentanyl is the moral equivalent of murder. That is why we demand mandatory, harsh prison sentences for those who manufacture, import, export and traffic fentanyl. Those who profit from addiction must face swift and serious consequences. The government's unwillingness to adopt these common-sense measures sends a clear message: Criminals can operate with impunity while Canadians suffer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925702">The failures do not end there. The Liberals also refuse to acknowledge their abject failure on border security, another critical element that Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> purportedly aims to address. Earlier this year, the Canada Border Services Agency revealed that 600 foreign criminals were scheduled for deportation, but now they have gone missing in custody. This is completely unacceptable and represents a grave threat to public safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925703">Canada's border must be secure to protect Canadians from criminals and illegal activities, including fentanyl trafficking and gun smuggling. Canadians deserve better from their government, one that respects their privacy, does not overreach with warrantless surveillance powers and is serious about fighting fentanyl by imposing real consequences on traffickers. Canadians deserve a government that protects our borders, enforces immigration laws fairly and firmly and supports law enforcement in combatting organized crime, and a government that does not leave foreign criminals at large in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925704">Canadians are looking to this House for leadership, not partisanship, on critical issues like public safety and immigration. While we have serious concerns about how the government first approached matters in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, we also acknowledge that Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> represents a step in the right direction. This very step came because Canadians raised their voices and the Conservatives did our job: We were listening, we pushed back and we demanded better on behalf of the citizens of this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925705">Our work here is not done. We will support moving Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> to committee, where it will be scrutinized carefully, and we will work to improve it even further.</ParaText>

Lloyd, the Supreme Court ruled that the government should narrow its scope for mandatory minimum sentencing, and that is exactly what I spoke about in my speech. We should narrow the scope and target it toward people who are trafficking, importing and producing fentanyl. We should target it toward organized crime and, as we said before, have the harshest mandatory minimums for people who produce and traffic in excess of 45 milligrams, which is a lethal dose. That is very targeted and specific and fits the scope.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8925720">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise today as the member of Parliament for Windsor West to speak to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, an act respecting certain measures relating to the security of Canada's borders and the integrity of the Canadian immigration system and respecting other related security measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925721">Let us begin with how we got here. The original version, Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, was deeply flawed. It would have given the government warrantless access to Canadians' financial data and unchecked powers to manipulate platforms. It would even have allowed Canada Post to open private letters without a warrant. All of this was proposed without consulting the Privacy Commissioner, of all people. Conservatives and Canadians said it was enough, so our Liberal friends backed down. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925722">Now we have Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>. It is more focused, yes, but it still misses the mark, especially when it comes to public safety, border integrity, and fentanyl and meth trafficking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925723">Windsor is Canada's busiest border crossing, handling over half a billion dollars in trade every single day, yet our frontline agencies there are stretched thin, underfunded, understaffed and overwhelmed. When President Trump raised concerns earlier this year about the northern border, Ottawa scrambled. The government spent $5.3 million leasing Black Hawk helicopters and flew 68 patrol missions in just six weeks. That program has ended, by the way. The RCMP called it rapid response capability, but only one interdiction came out of all that effort. That is not enforcement; it is border security theatre.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925724">Senator Sandra Pupatello, who hails from Windsor, recently raised the alarm about illegal crossings by kayaks and motorboats in southwestern Ontario. She is absolutely right that if it floats, it can be used to smuggle guns, meth, fentanyl and cash. It is all moving across the river, yet the federal government continues to ignore the voices of those on the ground who are sounding the alarm. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925725">Canada's failure to act has had consequences far beyond our borders. After an investigation done by W5, a report aired this past week. According to W5, a young man named Aiden Sagala died in New Zealand in 2023, after unknowingly drinking liquid meth disguised as beer, which was exported from right here in Canada. He was just 21 years old. Authorities in New Zealand seized 29,000 cans shipped from Toronto. Did we do anything about it? Sadly, no. There were no charges, no suspects and no answers. The RCMP has remained silent. That is not just negligence; it is a public safety failure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925726">Since 2016, 49,000 Canadians have died from opioid overdoses, and I have been to a few funerals myself. Seventy-nine per cent of those deaths involved fentanyl, yet Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> does not include mandatory minimum sentences for fentanyl or meth traffickers or for gang members using firearms. That is not progress. That is abdication of the government's responsibility to Canadian citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925727">In British Columbia, labs are producing kilograms of fentanyl every week. These criminals are profiting from addiction and misery. Canada has become a low-risk, high-reward destination for traffickers, and not just for drugs. We have also become a haven for money laundering, with billions flowing through shell companies, real estate and even casinos. TD got fined last year by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for these kinds of activities. This is not just a health crisis but a national security emergency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925728">Our bail system is broken. Known traffickers and repeat violent offenders are walking free, sometimes the very same day they are arrested. In Windsor and across Ontario, auto theft is up 167%, extortion is up 350%, and firearms violence is up 97%. Roughly 90% of the guns that are used in crimes are smuggled across our borders. There are no answers to that either. What is not up, one might ask? Resources, helicopter patrol hours, Coast Guard funding and border surveillance equipment are not up. We are asking our officers to do more with less while criminals operate with complete impunity.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8925729">Windsor is not just the front line of Canada's economy; it is now the front line of the drug crisis and the fight to secure our borders. If the government cannot track lethal drugs hidden in beverage cans that are exported overseas where innocent people are dying, how can we trust it to protect our own communities?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925730">We are not just risking lives; we are also risking our relationship with other nations, and our reputation as a reliable security partner is also being questioned. The question we need to ask ourselves is this: What message are we sending to our allies, our citizens and the brave officers who are out there? Whether they are from CBSA, the RCMP or municipal or provincial police services, what are they expecting of us, and how are we helping them to stay safe?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925731">Conservatives support sending the bill to committee. There are elements worth exploring, but we will be pushing for serious amendments to ensure that law-abiding Canadians are protected, criminals are held accountable and border communities like Windsor are no longer left behind. Canada's border is not just a line on the map; it is a front line in crisis, and it is time we started treating it that way, with urgency, investment and real leadership.</ParaText>

They have values they follow. They sacrifice. They miss birthdays and weddings so all of us stay safe. They miss Christmases and Thanksgivings with their family.

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> This enactment amends the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Act to add certain requirements for the tabling in Parliament of documents relating to treaties entered into by the Minister of Foreign Affairs on behalf of Canada. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925757">More specifically, Bill C‑228 provides for the following: systematic tabling of treaties in the House of Commons; a requirement to wait 21 days after tabling before ratifying treaties in order to give the House an opportunity to consider them; and publication of treaties in the Canada Gazette and on the website of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925758">I will define what we mean by “major treaty” later on, but the bill proposes a requirement to obtain the advice of the House before ratifying major treaties and a requirement to consult civil society through a parliamentary committee before Parliament votes on major treaties, which I will come back to later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925759">Canada is currently bound by 4,400 international treaties. These are treaties in the broad sense and include agreements, protocols, conventions and amendments to existing treaties. These are all examples of different kinds of international treaties. Treaties affect all aspects of society, including taxation, investment, exports, environmental protection, human rights, labour law, international trade, government procurement and standards to be applied to marketable products. These treaties clearly have a considerable impact on all aspects of life, both economic and political.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925760">I would like to point out that, in many cases, treaties are more important than laws. In today's world, who would deny that the free trade agreement between Canada and the United States has a greater impact on the people of Canada than the law governing Parliament's official poet? I picked a law at random. The current tariff crisis is demonstrating the consequences that a free trade agreement can have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925761">Furthermore, while any legislation passed in this Parliament could be amended in the next Parliament, the same cannot be said for treaties. Since they are essentially contracts between countries, they cannot be changed without the other country's consent. Meticulous and transparent review of treaties is even more essential given the relative permanence of treaties. Laws are passed after a well-established process that includes detailed study in committee after public hearings. Parliament, on the other hand, is largely excluded from the treaty-making process. That is not necessarily the case in other jurisdictions, and it is not how it works in other countries. In short, let me be clear: If the people's representatives are left out of the process, then the people are also being left out when it comes to ratifying treaties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925762">I would like to explain how international treaties are ratified. There are five main steps, and within those five main steps, there are a number of undemocratic processes that this bill attempts to fix.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925763"> The first step is to adopt a mandate. That is the starting point. Cabinet decides to start negotiations for a treaty and gives a mandate to the negotiator, setting objectives to be reached and red lines that must not be crossed. This is the mandate. The decision to start negotiations is generally public. We know that when the government wants to renegotiate CUSMA or develop new international treaty agreements, it is generally clear about its intentions. However, the negotiating mandate is not made public. The public remains in the dark about what will be negotiated and how.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8925764">Cabinet alone makes that decision, even if the proposed treaty deals with matters that are normally within the purview of Parliament and even if the treaty affects matters under the legislative jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces. Anyone can see that this is undemocratic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925765">After the mandate comes negotiation. This is when countries try to agree on a text that works for both of them. As we all know, this horse-trading, the entire negotiation process, takes place behind closed doors. Quebec and the provinces are generally not part of the negotiating teams, although they are often consulted and kept informed. Parliament, however, is rarely kept apprised of the status of ongoing negotiations and discussions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925766">The third step is signing the agreement. This is when countries wrap up negotiations, say they have agreed on a final text and commit to doing whatever their legislators need to do to ratify it. From that point on, there is a relatively final text that can be looked at. That is where Bill <Document DbId="13588678" Type="4">C‑228</Document> comes in. It would require the text of major treaties to be tabled in the House of Commons. Then, after committee scrutiny, the House would have to vote on those treaties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925767">Here is how we would define “major treaty”. Members can probably see where I am going. What we want to see is a treaty approval process comparable to the legislative process. Generally speaking, “major treaties” means those that require the enactment of a federal law, confer new powers on the government, impose a significant financial obligation, result in a change to Canada's boundaries, the imposition of sanctions, or a transfer of jurisdiction to international institutions, affect the government's jurisdiction, or concern international trade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925768">As an opposition party, we are clearly able to define what a major treaty is, yet the government is still unable to define what a project in the national interest is. That was just a friendly reminder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925769">The fourth step is implementation. At this stage, countries change their internal operations to bring them into compliance with the requirements of the agreement. We are talking about changes to laws, regulations and government programs. That is the only step that Parliament is currently involved in. However, it is important to note that Parliament currently does not become seized with the treaty itself and cannot propose changes to any aspect of it. The treaty is unalterable, and parliamentarians only consider amendments to existing laws that will allow it to come into force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925770">In fact, the very minimal impact we can have is through our control, so to speak, over existing legislation. Since trade treaty implementation legislation affects tariffs, which have a financial impact, a confidence vote is usually involved. That is another problem. If we refuse to accept a treaty tabled in the House, Parliament could potentially be dissolved. This gives the government a disproportionate amount of leverage. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925771">The fifth and final stage is ratification. This is the stage where the countries involved declare that their domestic laws are consistent with the requirements of the agreement and that they agree, under international law, to be bound by the obligations set out in the agreement. This stage comes under the exclusive authority of the executive branch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925772">If I can summarize, all these stages show that the process for ratifying international treaties is clearly undemocratic. In Canada, cabinet adopts the mandate unilaterally and keeps it secret. Federal negotiators report exclusively to the executive branch and do not have to report to anyone about the progress of discussions. The government alone brings the negotiations to a close and signs the final text of an agreement before disclosing it to anyone. Public debate is possible only after negotiations have ended and the text of the agreement is signed. That means it cannot be changed, whether by civil society, which can lobby elected officials, or by the elected officials themselves, whose ability to make changes is quite minimal.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8925773">In short, Parliament is essentially relegated to the role of a rubber-stamp chamber. It does not get to study the treaty itself. It merely adopts the changes to the laws that allow the treaty to come into force. During the review of the bill, any amendment that would affect the draft treaty is even ruled out of order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925774">Worse still, the government does its job with a knife to our throats, since laws to implement trade treaties generally affect taxation, which means they involve a confidence vote. That makes it impossible to change them. Either we approve them, or we face an election. Once again, this gives the executive branch a disproportionate amount of leverage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925775">What Bill <Document DbId="13588678" Type="4">C-228</Document> would do is make the treaty-making process a little more democratic in five ways, which I will summarize briefly. First, it would require all treaties to be tabled in the House of Commons. Second, it would require the government to wait 21 days after tabling before ratifying a treaty to give the House an opportunity to consider it. Third, treaties would have to be published in the Canada Gazette and on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development. Fourth, it would add a requirement to obtain the advice of the House before ratifying a major treaty, which I defined earlier. The requirement to obtain the opinion of the House is not binding. I will see what my colleagues have to say about that. Lastly, civil society would have to be consulted by means of a parliamentary committee before Parliament votes on major treaties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925776">Quite frankly, when it comes to treaties, Canada is one of the least democratic countries in the industrialized world. The bill we are introducing is somewhat inspired by what is being done in Quebec.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925777">In Quebec, there is an obligation to table and publish treaties. This obligation is set out in the Act respecting the Ministère des Relations internationales. This Quebec law also provides that the ratification of an international agreement or the making of an order cannot take place with respect to an important international commitment until the commitment is approved by the National Assembly. This mechanism allows the entire assembly, not just the executive branch, to express opinions. My colleagues will see that Bill C‑228 is largely based on the practice in Quebec, which requires that parliamentary approvals be published, and that is what Bill C‑228 seeks to replicate. It is also based on what is done in most European countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925778">Canada is lagging behind when it comes to transparency, democracy and treaties, and that can be seen simply by looking at what is done in Europe and the United States. Parliamentary approval of treaties is the norm rather than the exception in Europe. Belgium even requires that regions and communities give their approval before it ratifies a treaty that affects their jurisdictions. Obviously, Bill C‑228 does not go that far. In the United States, Congress itself adopts the negotiating mandate. It is kept informed of the discussions and must approve the text before ratification. In Europe, the European Commission cannot enter into trade negotiations without the authorization of the European Parliament and a mandate from the member states represented on the European Council.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925779"> It is clear that, in many countries, parliaments adopt treaties through a far more democratic process. Furthermore, in some European countries, the adoption of treaties is considered important enough to be enshrined in their constitutions. That is the case in France, Germany, Denmark and Italy. Pursuant to its constitution, the U.S. must obtain legislative approval for certain categories of international agreements before they can be ratified.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925780">In terms of transparency, Canada made some progress under the Harper government. I am sure that my Conservative colleagues will be pleased to hear this. It was in 2008 that the government outlined a new policy requiring all treaties signed by Canada and other states or entities to be tabled in the House before being ratified.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8925781">However, the tabling of treaties in the House remains a courtesy, similar to the courtesy shown by the Chair in letting me know that my speaking time is over. I am looking forward to hearing my colleagues' opinions. I believe that this is a bill that calls for greater democracy and transparency. I hope everyone shows such good faith.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925785">Madam Speaker, we need to focus on treaties that have a slightly broader scope. Why have all the other countries, like the European countries and the United States, decided to have a more democratic treaty-making process? I suppose it is because they believe in the role of elected officials when it comes to international treaties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925786">We have seen some major blunders in the past. I was first elected to the House in 2019, when Canada had just renegotiated CUSMA.

              <ParaText id="8925787">A Canadian negotiator candidly told us that this situation had come about because the problem was not addressed at the negotiating table.

              <ParaText id="8925790">If we had a more democratic law, such as this one and such as exists in Europe and the United States, would Parliament have had the tools and means to protect the supply management sector?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925791">Madam Speaker, what an intelligent question. I think that is fantastic. The answer is yes. During a recent discussion that my party caucus had with Daniel Johnson, who was premier of Quebec and also a trade agreement negotiator, Mr. Johnson told us how dysfunctional Canada's approach was, since it does not involve the terms of negotiation being validated by its houses of assembly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925792">In the United States, the negotiating mandate comes from politicians. Unfortunately, that is not the case in Canada, which for a long time sidelined the much-debated issue of supply management; not only is it essential to Quebec, but it also serves the interests of other agricultural producers in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925793">It took a lot of painstaking work by the Bloc Québécois to get supply management on the federal government's legislative agenda. We had to fight with senators. During CUSMA negotiations, this issue could have been resolved quickly if the House had been asked, and perhaps even if Quebec City had been consulted to find out what was important to them in trade negotiations.</ParaText>

I am grateful for his work on this important and timely issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925795">The debate on this bill touches on fundamental principles of our democracy and our constitutional framework. In a global context marked by geopolitical uncertainty, it is essential to ensure that Canada's treaty-making system reflects today's reality. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925796">First, I rise today to reaffirm the integrity, transparency, and accountability that are already built into Canada's treaty-making process. This includes the essential step of tabling treaties in Parliament. This step is a more recent addition to our tradition, but it has been respected and supported by Canadian governments of all political stripes since the January 2008 announcement of the policy on tabling treaties in Parliament.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8925797">Since the introduction of the policy on the tabling of treaties in Parliament in 2008, successive governments have maintained a strong commitment to transparency by regularly tabling treaty texts before the House. These documents, along with negotiating positions and impact assessments, are made available to parliamentary committees, allowing Parliament to exercise oversight.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8925798">Our government will always take a strong stand for transparency in Canada's international agreements and partnerships. As we endeavour to diversify our relationships abroad, we agree that there can be no compromise on transparency to Parliament.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925800">As members of the House know, the authority to enter into international treaties on behalf of Canada belongs to the elected government. Like many of our allies who also follow the Westminster model, our government has a mandate to negotiate, sign and ratify treaties on behalf of Canada for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8925801">It is important to recognize that the constitutional authority to enter into treaties rests with the elected government of the day, consistent with the Westminster parliamentary tradition. As with many of our allies who share this system, the executive branch is tasked with negotiating, signing and ratifying treaties on behalf of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8925802">At the same time, parliamentary control and transparency are central to our democratic governance. The current policy framework offers a number of opportunities for parliamentary participation by the provinces, territories, indigenous groups and relevant stakeholders, from preliminary consultations during treaty planning and negotiations, right up to tabling of the treaties prior to their ratification.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925803">For nearly 20 years, since 2008, successive governments have tabled treaties in Parliament in accordance with the requirements of the policy on tabling treaties in Parliament. This process is not a mere formality; it embodies the philosophy that underpins our system of government. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8925804">As we begin the debate on Canada's current treaty-making process, it is important that we all understand what exactly our current policy is and what level of openness, input and transparency it affords to Parliament.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8925805">First, a government's accountability in the treaty process begins well before signing or ratifying a treaty. It begins with the planning stage. As the policy states, when a negotiating mandate is developed, public servants must demonstrate that they have conducted a comprehensive consultation process. This process involves not only federal departments, but also, depending on the subject of the treaty, the provinces and territories, indigenous peoples, as well as civil society in the form of non-governmental organizations, academia and industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925806">Second, these consultations continue throughout the negotiation phase. Stakeholders are consulted, including provincial and territorial governments where certain provisions of the treaty fall within their constitutional jurisdiction. In the case of multilateral negotiations, representatives of these groups are often part of Canadian delegations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925807">Third, for agreements of major economic importance, including trade agreements, additional transparency measures were put in place in 2020. These additional measures require that the government table in Parliament a notice of intent to negotiate at least 90 days before the discussions begin and that negotiation objectives be tabled 30 days before.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8925808">Fourth, the requirement to table the text of international treaties in Parliament before taking any action intended to bind Canada is an essential component of our commitment to accountability.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8925809">During these treaty-tabling periods, opposition parties have the option to seek a vote and pursue a debate in the House regarding the treaty in question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925810">Fifth, where the fulfillment of the obligations in a treaty requires amendments to federal legislation, a bill to implement those obligations is presented to this House and follows the standard procedures for the adoption of law. This again provides significant opportunities for review, examination, debate and approval by parliamentarians.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8925811">Finally, the commitment to public transparency is also reflected in the publication and registration of treaties. Once in force, they become publicly available, they are registered with the United Nations and they are kept in the public domain, ensuring their visibility both in Canada and internationally.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8925812">For treaties with significant economic implications, such as free trade agreements, the government introduced enhanced transparency measures in 2020. These include the requirement to table a notice of intent to negotiate and the negotiation objectives in this House before talks begin. Furthermore, Parliament's approval is required before implementation legislation can be enacted, ensuring legislative scrutiny before these treaties take full effect domestically.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925813">In summation, the current parliamentary review process for treaties has seen over 450 treaties brought before this House since 2008, providing members with opportunities for examination, debate and, if desired, votes. When treaties require amendments to federal laws, such changes must pass through the normal legislative process, offering further opportunities for parliamentary review.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8925814">It is true that Bill <Document DbId="13588678" Type="4">C‑228</Document> seeks to strengthen parliamentary participation by requiring prior approval of treaties. That is an honourable goal shared by every member of the House.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8925815"> However, we should be cautious about any changes to our ratification process, particularly when they may introduce delays and uncertainties that could hinder Canada's ability to negotiate effectively and respond swiftly to evolving global circumstances.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8925816">This year alone, nearly 20 treaties have been tabled in Parliament. Under the process outlined in this bill, each of these treaties would have had to spend months in committee and months more awaiting the drafting of a government report, meaning several years' delay in the implementation of international agreements that have earned our country a global reputation as a reliable partner.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925825">Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from the Bloc Québécois for bringing this bill forward. I think it will give us an opportunity to talk about the treaty process here in Canada and in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8925826">The first multilateral treaty negotiated and signed by Canada was the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. The first bilateral treaty negotiated and signed by Canada was the Halibut Treaty between Canada and the United States in 1923. Before that, the United Kingdom negotiated, signed and ratified treaties on behalf of all of the countries in the empire. Full treaty authority was not fully delegated to Canada until 1947, with the issuance of the Letters Patent, 1947. As I think my colleague mentioned, there are some 4,400 treaties that Canada has entered into or has been bound by over the years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925827">An important starting point for this particular private member's bill is discussing the nomenclature of a treaty. Under the Vienna convention that codified international practice in 1969, Canada defines a treaty as “a single instrument” or “two or more related instruments” and indicates that treaties can come in various forms of description. They can be called treaties, conventions, agreements, protocols or some similar word. They can be a simple exchange of diplomatic notes or a simple exchange of diplomatic letters. All of these are incorporated into what Canada considers to be a treaty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925828">What is not a treaty is an arrangement or a memorandum of understanding. Those two documents are not considered by Canada to be treaties, although other states consider them to be treaties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925829"> It is important to start with that description of what we in Canada call a treaty before we go on to a discussion of the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925830">When I look at Bill <Document DbId="13588678" Type="4">C-228</Document>, I note that it further defines a treaty as an amendment to a treaty. Treaties are not simply the original bilateral, multilateral or plurilateral agreement; any amendment to such an agreement is also considered a treaty in the definition provided by the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925831"> The bill then goes on to define what a major treaty is. When I read the bill, a major treaty seems to encompass pretty much all treaties. They are almost one and the same. A major treaty is defined as any treaty that requires for its implementation “the enactment of an Act of Parliament”, “the conferment of new powers on His Majesty in Right of Canada”, or “the imposition of a tax by Parliament”; “imposes a significant direct or conditional financial obligation on Canada”; “concerns the transfer of part of Canada’s territory”; “requires Canada to impose...economic or military sanctions on a state”; or “concerns the territorial jurisdiction of Canada”. In the final two descriptions, a major treaty is any treaty that “concerns international trade or investment” or “concerns Canada’s participation in international institutions”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925832">When we look at what a major treaty is as defined in the bill, it pretty much encompasses all treaties. A very broad set of treaties would be defined and captured by this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925833">What the bill would do can be summarized by three elements. The first is it would codify existing policy and practice by the Government of Canada and the practice here in the House of Commons, which my hon. colleague across the aisle called the Ponsonby convention.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8925834">As an aside, I might mention that one of the primary schools I went to when I was a kid was Ponsonby Public School, which is just down the road from where I grew up. It was probably named after the person who authored the convention, but it is the Ponsonby rule that had been in place in the United Kingdom since 1924. That rule in the United Kingdom has been codified into law by the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925835">What we currently do here in practice in the House, what the government currently does in policy, which was enacted by the Harper government in 2008, is being proposed to be codified by the bill that is before us, and I think that is an interesting idea. It is something the U.K. has done, but in practice I do not think it would make any real change to the way we consider treaties here in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925836">The second and third elements of the private member's bill would change significantly how we deal with treaties. The second element is that “the Minister must obtain the advice of the House of Commons regarding the treaty before ratifying it.” In other words, the minister needs to ensure that a debate and a vote take place in the House as a whole for each treaty laid before the House. The third element of the bill is that all major treaties would be reviewed by a committee of the House and that the committee would have to report back to the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925837">I think the second and third elements of the bill would be a problem, and I want to explain why. As my hon. colleague mentioned, there are some 4,400 treaties that Canada is party to. Let us just assume that they have been negotiated over about 100 years; that means about 44 treaties a year. That would be a lot of treaties for the House to debate and to vote on each and every time. It would be a lot of work for a committee to review and report back to the House each and every time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925838">Seeing that the House typically sits only 26 or 27 weeks a year, we would be looking at having a day of debate and a vote in the House pretty much three days out of every two weeks the House is sitting, and the committees of the House would also be tasked three times every 10 sitting days with reviewing and reporting back on a treaty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925839">I looked at the statistics for the last five Parliaments, beginning with the 41st Parliament, about the number of treaties that have been laid before the House. In the 41st Parliament, which lasted about four years, there were 142 treaties that were laid in front of the House, which is roughly 110 a year. In the 42nd Parliament, which sat for four years, there were 91 treaties that were laid before the House, which is a rate of roughly 22 treaties each sitting year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925840">In the 43rd Parliament, which was the pandemic Parliament, when arguably, even though it lasted for a year and a half, we really sat for only about a year, 32 treaties were negotiated during the roughly 20 to 30 weeks the House sat. In the 44th Parliament, over three years, 62 treaties were laid in front of the House. Just in the first eight weeks of the current Parliament, I counted ministers' laying before the House 17 treaties, at a rate of roughly more than two a week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925841">When I look at what the bill proposes, I think it would be an undue burden on the House and its committees. I think that three treaties every 10 sitting days being laid before the House, triggering a debate with a commensurate vote, and three treaties every 10 calendar days being sent to committee for review and report would put a big burden on the House and distract us from the other critical work we need to do in this place.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8925842"> I will finish by saying that I think this is a well-intentioned bill that has allowed us to shine a light on the Ponsonby Rule, which has been in place here in the chamber since the Harper government issued the policy through a ministerial statement in 2008. Some of the aspects of the bill are interesting, such as the codification of that rule into law, but I think the way the bill has been worded in its second and third elements, related to a review and vote in the House and its committees, would put an undue burden on the House.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925843">Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to rise this evening as the Bloc Québécois critic for international trade to speak to Bill <Document DbId="13588678" Type="4">C‑228</Document>. This bill, which I think is very important, seeks to strengthen transparency and parliamentary oversight around trade agreements. Ottawa's lack of transparency in these matters is downright monarchical.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925844">I have been here for six years, and as my colleagues have said, not once have we voted on a trade agreement. We have always voted on bills to implement agreements. This means that it is virtually impossible to amend them and they are always tabled under very tight deadlines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925845">I also find it somewhat ironic to hear people saying that we have a policy on treaty-making. Apparently, because we have had this wonderful policy since 2008, everything is fine. I find it ironic to hear that today considering that the policy was violated just a few days ago. This policy, which is not a law and is therefore non-binding by definition, normally provides for a 21-day period between the announcement of the content of an agreement and the introduction of a bill. However, the bill on the protocol on the United Kingdom's entry into the Trans-Pacific Partnership was introduced after only 15 days, so I find it very funny to hear today that this policy is perfect when it was not even respected just a few days ago. In other words, perhaps they need to find a better argument. Let us get the message across to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925846">Whatever the issue and whatever the political leanings of the government, Ottawa does not appreciate its opponents scrutinizing its actions too closely. When it comes to trade agreements, secrecy is the name of the game. Canada is living up to its monarchical tradition by keeping the agreements it signs under wraps, no doubt for fear that they would fall apart under scrutiny, much like a vampire exposed to the sun.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925847">As a member of Parliament, I experienced this in December 2020. I was on the Standing Committee on International Trade and we were asked to study the proposed free trade agreement between Canada and the United Kingdom but without seeing the text of the agreement. Who would have thought that possible? We heard from witnesses, senior officials and representatives of organizations. Their recommendation was to adopt the agreement, despite concerns about this thing or that. At one point, I raised my hand to say that I had not read the agreement. I asked the witnesses if they had information I did not have. One by one, they each told me that they did not know, that they had not received any information. Is that not unbelievable? It really was a theatre of the absurd. Only in Canada could such a thing happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925848">When Canada's foreign affairs department was created in 1909, the minister was supposed to table before Parliament an annual report on the department's operations. This report would logically include an overview of Canada's international discussions and commitments. This was somewhat of an attempt to demonstrate the beginnings of a desire for transparency. In 1995, at the height of globalization, the department's act was amended to give the minister a freer hand by granting him jurisdiction over international trade, to the detriment of Parliament. The 1909 annual reporting requirement was abolished in 1995.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925849">I will take another look back in time. In 1926, the House of Commons passed a resolution stating that “...before His Majesty's Canadian Ministers advise ratification of a treaty or convention affecting Canada, or signify acceptance of any treaty, convention or agreement involving military or economic sanctions, the approval of the parliament of Canada should be secured.” That is what was passed, but in actual fact, this practice was applied unevenly for 40 years until it was finally abandoned in 1966. A parliament worthy of the name should adopt procedures aimed at increasing the level of democratic control over agreements.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8925850">My political party, the Bloc Québécois, introduced seven bills on the procedure for reaching agreements between 1999 and 2004, requiring the minister responsible for the ratification of an agreement to table it in Parliament, along with an explanatory memorandum, within a reasonable time frame, and requiring the approval of members of Parliament before any ratification. As a result of the Bloc Québécois's efforts, it is now policy that an explanatory memorandum be submitted within a reasonable time before an agreement is ratified by elected members, but no government has ever had the courage to create binding legislation. As I said, this policy was violated just a few days ago, yet they have the gall to use that as an argument today. It is unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925851">As a result, the government can act arbitrarily, as the Liberals have just done once again. We are certainly not a British regime where Parliament is supposed to have partial veto rights over ratifications. While fundamentally desirable despite being ridiculously inadequate, this policy consisting in asking members what they think after the fact could be a means of controlling Parliament. Rather than really involving members in the drafting of international agreements, this policy is merely an instrument to sound out the opposition parties' position, since they are presented with a finished product that is all ready to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925852"> Some parliaments around the world even consult elected members before starting negotiations to obtain mandates on sectors to be promoted or protected. That is vastly different from what we have here. The United States, for example, has a law that protects the sugar sector, while the European Union frequently holds votes to ask its members what they would like to see protected, promoted or, conversely, removed from the table. The principle makes sense. Members of Parliament are elected by the public to represent the interests and values of their constituents. Given its lack of transparency before, during and after trade negotiations, Canada has a long way to go when it comes to involving members of Parliament in the process. It also falls far short when it comes to involving the provinces. However, this is another issue that the current bill does not address. Nevertheless, it shows how ridiculous Ottawa is when it comes to democracy and transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925853">The way the process works in Canada can be summarized as follows: First, cabinet unilaterally adopts the mandate and keeps it secret. Second, the Canadian negotiators report only to the federal executive branch and are not accountable to anyone regarding the status of discussions. When they appear before the Standing Committee on International Trade, they tell us next to nothing, regardless of whether the meeting is in camera or public. Third, the government alone ends the negotiations and signs the final text before sharing it with anyone. Fourth, public debate can only begin once negotiations have concluded. At that point, the signed text is impossible to change. Parliament is essentially relegated to the role of rubber-stamping the treaty. It never votes on or debates the treaty itself, but rather an implementation bill. Ultimately, we can change next to nothing or nothing at all. We end up with an implementation bill that is a few pages long for treaties that can sometimes be 5,000 pages long.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925854">Parliament simply adopts the changes to the laws that will allow the treaty to come into force. During the study of the bill, any amendment that would affect the draft treaty is ruled out of order because it is only the implementation bill. I find it unfortunate that our Conservative friends are opposed to our bill, as far as we know, because virtually all of their proposed amendments to the free trade bill with Ukraine were rejected and ruled out of order. I voted against the Conservatives' proposed amendments, because I disagreed with them. However, each time they were ruled out of order, I still voted with the Conservatives in committee to challenge the chair's decision, because it seemed logical to me that these proposals should still be debated and put forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925855">Today, the Conservatives are defending the same policy that prevented them from changing anything back then. What a brilliant move. Ultimately, Parliament ends up doing its job with a knife to its throat, and that is what—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925858">Madam Speaker, I am happy to rise tonight to speak to Bill <Document DbId="13588678" Type="4">C-228</Document>, legislation that would fundamentally reshape how Canada affirms its treaties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925859">I will admit that this is not quite the agreement I hoped to be speaking to after more than five months of trade negotiations with the U.S. Still, Bill <Document DbId="13588678" Type="4">C-228</Document> raises issues that go to the very heart of how Parliament exercises its constitutional role.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925860">The intent behind this private member's bill is commendable. It seeks to give Parliament a stronger voice in the treaty process to make the approval and adoption of agreements more transparent and accountable. Those are principles I support, but while the goal is worthy, I believe the way this bill goes about achieving it is flawed. At the risk of echoing some of the thoughtful concerns by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="317864" Type="2">Wellington—Halton Hills North</Affiliation>, I would like to briefly outline the key provisions of this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925861">As written, the legislation would do three things. First, it would formalize the practice of ministers tabling major treaties in this place prior to ratification, along with an explanatory note. Second, it would require a committee of the House to review any proposed treaty and report back to the House. Third, it would require the Minister of Foreign Affairs to obtain the advice of the House before ratification.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925862">While I am all for giving this place a bigger voice in the machinations of government, I am concerned about the second aspect of the bill, namely the requirement of a committee of the House to review and report back. My concerns are threefold. First, what is the purpose of sending proposed treaties to committee? Second, can the committees, as they are currently constituted, actually carry out the massive increase in workload Bill <Document DbId="13588678" Type="4">C-228</Document> would necessitate? Third, and perhaps most important, I am concerned about a potential chilling effect it may have in a negotiating process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925863">To be clear, this is not a question of effort. The reality is that there are just not enough hours in a day, a week or a month for parliamentarians to thoroughly scrutinize the dozens, if not hundreds, of additional documents that could be sent to the relevant House committees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925864">To provide some context, since 2008, 467 treaties have been tabled in the House. By my napkin math, during that same time period, 341 pieces of government legislation have passed committee and received royal assent. We already face severe limitations on our ability to analyze legislation and conduct studies at our committees. With the addition of proposed treaties being sent into the room, the very few hours we have would be reduced even further. This means less legislation passed, fewer treaties approved, fewer private members' bills agreed to and fewer studies in committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925865">For a microcosm, in the 41st Parliament, former prime minister Stephen Harper and his strong, stable, national majority government tabled 142 treaties in the House. If this bill were law then, that would mean that that Parliament would have had 142 additional study topics and 142 other very important committee meetings that would not have occurred. This is assuming the absolute best-case scenario, where each treaty is approved by all parties with little or no debate. Who knows how long a treaty may require at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925866">This leads to my second concern with the proposal to send this to committee, which is the simple question, why? Parliamentarians do not have the capacity to amend or change the wording of a proposed treaty. We are simply there to say yea or nay. We are not involved in the negotiation process. The government is, with ministers, skilled public servants, subject matter experts and diplomats hammering out minutia after minutia. I am curious as to what members would envision the committee process would look like. Would we treat the treaty like legislation? Almost everyone in this place has done line-by-line consideration of legislation before. We know how tedious, but necessary, it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925867">Let us engage in a bit of a thought experiment. Let us say that tomorrow this legislation achieves royal assent, and additionally, the government announces we have a renegotiated CUSMA. It is a trilateral trade deal with revisions and additions. CUSMA then gets sent to the international trade committee. The agreement is about as long as the previous one, ringing in at just under 1,900 pages. What happens next? Do they do line-by-line consideration or clause-by-clause consideration? How are the offices expected to do due diligence in understanding each clause in the little time we have?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8925868">Does the committee supply simply a nay or yea? Does this end the deal? How much time is given to the committee and its members to consider the document? Does a 10-page treaty get the same amount of time for MPs to familiarize themselves with as a 2,000-page behemoth? Does rejecting the treaty mean that trade talks collapse?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925869">This highlights an unfortunate reality that the legislation could not meet. Either the process is fulsome and done with attention to detail and due process that it deserves, in which case it quite possibly cripples the workload of the relevant committee, or it turns into a rubber-stamping process, in which case it is irrelevant and not needed. This, of course, ignores the other elephant in the room: It provides all parties with another legislative process that could be politically weaponized, further delaying the process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925870">All of this leads to a third issue that, in my opinion, is by far the most serious. This may be the first time that members will ever hear a Tory say this in the House, but the legislation's most worrisome aspect is the potential effect this will have on limiting the authority of the current government to do its job. The legislation would have a massive chilling effect on the government's ability to negotiate in good faith with other governments. Simply put, why would the nations of the world put any faith or effort into the treaty negotiation processes if the entire process can be derailed or held up in Parliament? This is particularly poignant given what is happening right now in Washington. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925871">To be clear, the Conservatives wish nothing but total success to the government in its negotiating efforts with the U.S. We all want what is best for Canada and the U.S. We may disagree on how we are going to get there, but our goal is the same. I would like to take this opportunity to place on the parliamentary record my continued commitment, that of my team and myself, to extend our co-operation and support to the government negotiating team in any way we can. I reiterate to the <Affiliation DbId="318683" Type="4">Minister responsible for Canada-U.S. Trade</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="318631" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="318629" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> directly that my door remains open and that my commitment to constructive co-operation and engagement with our U.S. neighbours is unwavering. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925872">However, I want to be clear: Members should understand that the willingness to co-operate does not exempt the government from rightful scrutiny and criticism where it is warranted. It also means that the government needs to signal its intent to actually engage with the opposition to get the best deal possible for Canada and end this unjust, unprovoked trade dispute. To bring this back to Bill <Document DbId="13588678" Type="4">C-228</Document>, the last thing I would like to do during any negotiation process is to signal to any potential trading partners that the government does not have the agency to negotiate on behalf of the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925873">In closing, Bill <Document DbId="13588678" Type="4">C-228</Document> is guided by good intentions to strengthen Parliament's role in treaty approval. However, as drafted, it risks slowing decision-making and blurring the line between advisory oversight and executive responsibility. I would like to applaud the member for <Affiliation DbId="317878" Type="2">Jonquière</Affiliation> for his vision and efforts to empower this place, but, unfortunately, I cannot support the implementation of that vision as is. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925875">Madam Speaker, during question period in the spring, I pointed out that the Liberal government had no plan when it came to the then already-metastasizing youth unemployment crisis. Things have continued to get worse and the government still has no plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925876">Youth unemployment, according to the latest StatsCan numbers, has jumped to 14.7%. We are now approaching half a million unemployed young people in the country between the ages of 15 and 24. This means hopes eroding and opportunities lost. Young people who want to work hard, contribute and get ahead are not able to because of the failed policies of the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925877">We have called on the government to adopt a plan to reverse its bad policies, a plan to help young people get back to work. We have done more than just suggest that it put forward a plan. We have actually put forward a plan ourselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925878">Last week, the Conservative Party released our Conservative youth jobs plan here in Ottawa. That plan was released in a constructive spirit, in the hopes that the Liberals would adopt our youth jobs plan as part of their budget. They have no plan, but we have a plan, and we put it forward in the hopes that the Liberals would adopt it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925879">Our Conservative youth jobs plan has four elements. We are calling on the government to unleash the economy, fix immigration, fix training and build homes where the jobs are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925880">When it comes to unleashing the economy, the Liberals need to reverse policies that are blocking economic development. They need to repeal Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, repeal Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document>, get rid of the production cap, eliminate the industrial carbon tax to allow our energy sector to move forward. More than that, they need to address the red tape and high taxes that are making it so difficult to start and grow a business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925881">They need to implement our proposals to stimulate economic activity. We proposed, in the last election, that the government eliminate the capital gains tax for dollars that are immediately reinvested here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925882">These measures would unleash our economy and help young people get back to work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925883">The second part of our plan is to fix immigration. We put forward constructive proposals on immigration, recognizing that under the Liberal government, the system has gotten way out of whack with our labour market needs. We keep hearing experts, during public hearings at the human resources committee study, speak about how Liberal policies on immigration have particularly exacerbated challenges for youth and working-class people by not having effective screening based on skills and by not aligning our immigration system with our labour market. The Liberals need to address these immigration failures. They need to unleash the economy, fix immigration and fix training.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925884">We have proposed significant new investments to support union-based training and support trades programs in high schools. Also, student loan programs should offer relatively more generous support for students pursuing studies in high-demand fields. Right now, loans and grants are offered regardless of the program students are studying in. We are proposing that relatively more generous support be offered to students who are pursuing in-demand fields.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925885">Finally, we need incentives to assist employers that build employee housing so that they build homes where the jobs are. We are proposing a 100% accelerated capital cost writeoff for employers that build employee housing. This plan would help get housing built where jobs are and would make it easier for unemployed young people in regions of high unemployment to move to areas where there are jobs and opportunity and find housing along the way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925886">This is our plan to unleash the economy, fix immigration, fix training and build homes where the jobs are. The Liberals have no plan to address the metastasizing youth unemployment crisis. Conservatives have a plan. Will the Liberals adopt our plan in the budget?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925887">Madam Speaker, governments, businesses and workers are navigating new challenges because labour is changing at a dizzying pace. We are looking at a whole new kind of labour market. Many workers are retiring from important sectors, which will lead to critical labour shortages. Some 600,000 skilled trades workers will retire by 2031. That means 600,000 new job opportunities are opening up. On top of that, we expect 400,000 new jobs to be created by the end of this decade alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925888">Canada's workforce has a generational opportunity to renew. That is why we have a plan to help Canadians gain a foothold in the job market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925889">It starts with youth employment. The Canada summer jobs program has a proven track record of providing many young Canadians with their first job. Since 2019, more than 460,000 young people have been helped by the program. After 70,000 jobs were initially created for the summer of 2025, this spring we added 6,000 more opportunities for young people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925890">That one program is working, year after year, to set young people up for a lifetime of success. In fact, we have supported over 138,000 opportunities for youth under the youth employment and skills strategy, which includes Canada summer jobs, the Canada service corps and the student work placement program.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8925891">Our goal is clear: to help young people develop their skills and gain the experience they need to enter the labour market as adults. So far, I have focused mainly on youth employment, because youth are at the heart of our economic future. However, our plan to help people get into the workforce is much broader.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8925892">Each year, the Government of Canada invests nearly $1 billion annually in apprenticeship supports through grants, loans, tax credits and employment insurance benefits. The skilled trades are one of the most important areas of job growth in Canada. Canada needs more homes for people, and in budget 2024, the government unveiled an ambitious plan to build 3.87 million new homes by 2031. However, we cannot build houses without the skilled trades, so we need to train thousands of new skilled tradespeople right now.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8925893">There is currently a high demand for many skilled trades. This includes automotive service and repair technicians, power line technicians, millwrights, horticulturalists, and truck and transport vehicle mechanics, to name a few.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925896">Madam Speaker, respectfully, the parliamentary secretary's response generally proved my point. She said there are changes in the workforce coming, and then she highlighted, as the government's response to those changes, the continuation of a program, the Canada summer jobs program, that has existed since the 1990s. I had barely been born when the program started.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925897">The continuation of a program that provides, on average, eight-week-long summer paid employment is not a response to the metastasizing crisis of now close to half a million young people being unemployed. They are not looking for eight-week jobs; they are looking for permanent jobs. That is why we need to unleash our economy, fix immigration, fix training and build homes where the jobs are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925898">We need to support the trades, and the tone matters. The government has spent 10 years running down trades workers and the sectors they work in by attacking the natural resource sector, by attacking the forestry sector and by undermining the value of trades work. When will it get a plan?</ParaText>

Here we go again today. Once again, the member opposite is using his time to spread unfounded conspiracy theories and get clips for social media.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925910">The answer today is the same as it was two weeks ago. I will spell this out clearly, even though we know the Conservatives will continue to spread incorrect information.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925911">Despite what the Conservatives would have us believe, Health Canada has no role in the day-to-day operations of Canadian Blood Services. It regulates the safety of blood and plasma collection and products made from blood and plasma. Canadian Blood Services operates independently from the federal government, working with the provinces and territories, outside Quebec, to collect plasma.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925912">The provinces and territories determine how plasma is collected in their jurisdictions, including the role of paid plasma collection. Canadian Blood Services has confirmed again and again that it does not sell the blood or plasma it collects from Canadians. It is selling a waste by-product called albumin to Grifols. Canada has more than enough albumin to meet the needs of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925913">Grifols turns this waste by-product into life-saving plasma. Canadian Blood Services then buys back the plasma at a significantly reduced rate, increasing our domestic blood supply. In fact, not only does this increase our blood supply, but it also creates jobs. A manufacturing facility for plasma products recently opened in Saint-Laurent, Montreal. This will establish Canada's first end-to-end domestic blood supply chain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925914">At a time when provincial and territorial partners need to increase their blood and plasma supplies, it is deeply disappointing that the Conservatives would rather spread misinformation and fear via social media clips. Canadians can rest assured that if they have donated plasma to Canadian Blood Services or Héma-Québec, it is going to Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8925922">Madam Speaker, I rise today to address concerns about public safety and bail reform. Canadians are rightly concerned about repeat and violent offending. They expect our justice system to keep communities safe while upholding the rule of law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925923"> Let me be clear. Former Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C‑75</Document> does not require courts to release violent offenders at the earliest opportunity and under the least onerous conditions. That characterization is simply false. Bill C‑75 modernized and clarified the bail provisions in the Criminal Code. It ensured that non-violent, low-risk individuals were not detained unnecessarily, while giving judges the discretion to detain dangerous individuals when public safety was at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925924"> These reforms codified the principle of restraint, a long-standing rule of criminal law that was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in 2017 in the Antic decision, which requires pre-trial detention to be ordered only when necessary to ensure the accused's attendance in court, to protect the public or to maintain confidence in the administration of justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925925">The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the presumption of innocence and the right to reasonable bail unless there is just cause for detention. These are the cornerstones of a free and democratic society. That said, the law is clear: No one should be released on bail if they pose a flight risk or a danger to the public, or if their release could undermine confidence in the justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925926">In 2024, Parliament strengthened these protections through former Bill <Document DbId="12426046" Type="3">C‑48</Document>, which expanded the reverse onus provision for intimate partner violence and made targeted amendments to better deal with repeat offenders and violent offences involving firearms and other weapons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8925927">The federal government is also investing $1.8 billion over four years to hire 1,000 new RCMP employees, increase federal policing capacity, and crack down on financial crime, online fraud, and organized criminal networks.
