              <ParaText id="8889461"> Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise today to present e-petition 6589. This petition was initiated by Lesley Fox from Port Alberni, British Columbia, and was signed by 10,800 Canadians who are deeply concerned about the risks and harms of fur farming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889462">The petitioners note that fur-farmed animals can carry high-risk zoonotic diseases, including coronaviruses and influenza. Intense breeding in captivity increases the risk of transmission between humans and animals. The petition highlights that British Columbia has already banned mink farming due to public health risk. Infectious disease specialists in Canada have called on the federal government to end fur farming altogether.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889463">The petitioners further raise concerns about the inhumane confinement and suffering of animals such as minks, foxes, chinchillas, lynx, bobcats and wolves, and they point out that over 20 countries have already banned fur farming. Public opinion in Canada overwhelmingly supports a nationwide prohibition.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889464">The petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to finally prohibit the practice of fur farming for all species of animals.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889466">The first petition is in regard to MAID. My constituents are concerned that advanced requests could lead to coercion or undue pressure, especially among older adults or those with disabilities, to request MAID to avoid burdening families or the health care system. There are ethical concerns among some health care professionals that carrying out MAID based on an old request without current confirmation could be seen as involuntary. There is a risk that death could be seen as a benefit contrary to what a patient might have desired.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889494">The petitioners say that offering medical assistance in dying as a “solution” for a disability or chronic illness reduces incentives to improve treatment and care for people with those conditions and that allowing medical assistance in dying for those with disabilities or chronic illnesses who are not dying devalues their life. The petitioners want to see the government change the existing regime to protect all Canadians whose natural death is not reasonably foreseeable. They want to see this happen by prohibiting medical assistance in dying for those whose prognosis for natural death is more than six months.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889508">It is always an honour to rise in the chamber to fight for law-abiding Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889509">The results are in on the Liberals' bail reform experiment, and they failed. They failed our victims. Their policies have failed survivors and their families. They have failed Canadians</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889510">If we look at the news headlines that Canadians are waking up to every single day, we see that they are tragic; they are heartbreaking. Extortions are running wild in our community. In Surrey, B.C.; in Peel; and in Calgary, business owners are scared. They are not even picking up calls from unknown phone numbers. We hear stories of broad-daylight shootings, of murders, including of a 70-year-old grandmother who went out to buy groceries and was randomly stabbed and killed on the street. There are violent carjackings. There are home invasions. Home is the place where we are supposed to be the safest; it is supposed to be our castle where we can be in peace to raise our family and live life. Now those areas are being targeted by repeat violent offenders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889511">Crime is up thanks to the Liberals' failed policies. Thanks to bills like Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document>, they have allowed repeat violent offenders to terrorize our communities over and over again. It is thanks to their decisions and their policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889512">The Liberals love to deny and to deflect, and to distract Canadians from their failed record, but they are responsible. In 2019 when they brought in Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, they codified the principle of restraint, which clearly says that judges, justices of the peace and police officers will release on the least restrictive conditions and at the earliest opportunity. That is a decision they made; they took that action and they presented it to Parliament. Conservatives voted against it then, and we are against the principle today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889513">Every single day that goes by, 1,600 violent crimes happen in our country. If we do the math, that is almost one Canadian per minute who falls victim to violent crime in Canada because of the Liberals' failure to act, and Canadians are scared; they are terrified. They are afraid to go on an evening walk in their neighbourhood. There are seniors in Oxford County who cannot even go to the bank without seeing security and without being nervous. That is not the Canada my parents came to. That is not the Canadian dream newcomers or folks who have been living here for generations love.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889514">It is the Liberals' policies that have let Canadians down, and the ironic part is that they said, and the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said in his campaign, that they were going to take decisive action and that they were going to be making changes to the Criminal Code right away. However, it has been six months, and we have not seen any legislation come forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889515">The Liberals keep talking about some magical bill for bail reform. “It's coming”, they say. Well, they did bail reform, and they failed, so we do not need any more Liberal bail policies. We need to scrap Liberal bail. We need to invest in making sure our frontline officers have the tools they need. We need to make sure the Criminal Code is reflective of today's realities, which is why last week I tabled the proposed jail not bail act.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8889516"> I did the homework for the Liberals about the jail not bail legislation. I know they are struggling to put something together. The bill came together from consultation and support from right across our country, from Whitehorse, Yukon, all the way to the east coast. I, along with my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="317928" Type="2">Brantford—Brant South—Six Nations</Affiliation>, and others from my Conservative team, have met with law enforcement and dozens of police unions. We have met with victim advocacy groups. I have met with the families of victims. I have sat at their tables and had conversations. They have cried because the situation is preventable. We did not have to be here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889517">Our bill has feedback from Crown prosecutors and from defence lawyers, from the legal community. More importantly, thousands of Canadians are signing our petition demanding that the government finally wake up, end the madness and restore safe streets in our country again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889518">Our opposition day motion is important so we can pass Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document>, the jail not bail act, as soon as possible. We want the Liberals to get out of the way, stop blocking safe communities, stop delaying, stop denying, stop chasing photo ops and media headlines, and instead focus on fighting crime for Canadians. We have seen this not just in the big cities; crime is now coming to rural Canada. Businesses are being affected. There is an economic cost. Emotional, social and security costs are being added on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889519">No one has seen this level of crime before. That is why my jail not bail act would repeal the principle of restraint that the Liberals brought in. We would introduce a principle of public safety as the primary consideration for bail decisions. Let us put the rights of law-abiding Canadians first, not the criminals like the Liberals have been doing for the last number of years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889520">My bill would introduce a new major offences category that would include violent crimes like arson, extortion, home invasions, carjackings and assaults on peace officers and that would become grounds for a reverse onus on the criminals to get bail. We would bring in legislation to add clarity to the Criminal Code to give judges the clarity they need by making it mandatory for judges to look at the criminal history of an accused person, for all offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889521">We would change and tighten risk assessment when it comes to granting bail on secondary grounds. We would add new measures as tertiary grounds. If someone who has a long rap sheet or has been charged with and convicted of an indictable offence over the last 10 years is released on bail and caught again, there should be no bail. We would tighten the conditions for bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889522">Right now in Canada, a criminal who has been indicted for a major offence can be a surety, can vouch for other criminals. We have seen that. Please tell me about that. There are criminals vouching for other criminals. How does that make any sense? A surety is supposed to be somebody who could support another person to make sure they stay out of trouble, but when there are criminals vouching for criminals, that is a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889523">Our bill is not about being partisan. We are asking for members' support and for them to put their partisanship aside and think about Canadians. The bill is a common-sense piece of legislation. It would protect Canadians. It would ensure that repeat violent offenders stay behind bars, where they belong, and it would restore safe streets in our communities once again.</ParaText>

Canadians are waking up every single day to read, see and hear about one heartbreaking story after another, usually about someone who has been killed, wounded, maimed or injured; someone who has had their car stolen or their home invaded; or someone who has been subject to sexual assault. Lo and surprise, individuals committing these offences are on numerous releases and are classified by police services as being well known to them, because they are repeat violent offenders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889545">That is the reality Canada is facing. This was not the reality prior to 2019. In 2019, there was a balance in our criminal justice system, in which the constitutional rights of the accused, such as the right to be presumed innocent and the right to reasonable bail, were balanced evenly with community safety and the safety of victims. We saw more releases and more detention orders, and people had a level of confidence that things were working as they were supposed to.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889549">Mr. Speaker, the government misled Canadians into believing that it was simply codifying language from the Supreme Court of Canada. The decision the Liberals were referring to was Antic, which basically reiterated the principles under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that apply to people who are factually innocent, although charged with a serious crime. Justin Trudeau and his ministers said they were taking the language from Antic and applying it to the Criminal Code, but the decision from Antic never directed the federal government to do anything. It was a reminder about the balance that needed to take place every single day in every single courthouse in this country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889550">Justin Trudeau and his then justice minister, David Lametti, decided to make it one step easier for criminals. They introduced the “Principle of restraint” under section 493.1 of the Criminal Code, which said that regardless of the grounds for detention in the Criminal Code, the primary ground for release was whether the person was going to show up for court. The secondary ground was whether there was a protection issue for the public and a presumption that this person was going to incur further charges if released. The tertiary ground was to maintain the confidence of the public, depending on the severity of the charge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889551">Those three grounds worked, but Justin Trudeau and David Lametti decided to introduce the principle of restraint. That telegraphed to every judge and justice of the peace hearing bail applications to this day that they “shall”, which is mandatory language, “release...the accused at the earliest...opportunity and on the least [restrictive] conditions”. This was regardless of what the charge was or the carnage the charge had caused to the community or to the victim. It was regardless of the offender's criminal record, which may have shown a pattern of breaching court orders or committing that same offence again. It was also, get this, regardless of the number of outstanding releases that person might be on. This person, according to the Liberal government, was worthy of release. That is the origin of catch-and-release. That is the reason we have the problems that exist today.</ParaText>

To my colleague from Woodstock, I say that this particular bill and our arguments are not partisan, because community safety is not a partisan issue. Every member in the House represents constituents, and those constituents want to wake up in homes that are still safe, with windows that are still intact, doors that have not been broken in and vehicles that are still in the driveway, where their kids can play safely in the backyard and play street hockey on the streets and not be hit by stray bullets or invaded at night, as we are constantly seeing, day after day.

Since the middle of July, 60,000 proud Canadians, Canadians those members in the government represent, have signed my petition.

              <ParaText id="8889578">Mr. Speaker, as Secretary of State for Combatting Crime, I appreciate the opportunity to debate this motion. Public safety and our bail and sentencing laws play a critical role in the criminal justice system. These are some of the most important laws that are supposed to ensure not only that justice is served but also that Canadians are safe in their communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889579"> Over the past years, Canadians have raised legitimate concerns about violent crime and repeat offending. These concerns are real, and our government is working hard with law enforcement, Crown attorneys and other levels of government across this country to act on them. It is encouraging to see alignment between the Conservative opposition and the newly elected Liberal government when it comes to improving public safety, including through the adoption of stronger laws to build safer communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889580"> I have good news for my colleagues. The <Affiliation DbId="318625" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> will be introducing legislation during this parliamentary session to comprehensively change parts of the Criminal Code and other aspects of the criminal justice system. These comprehensive changes would strengthen bail reform in this country, to have harsher, longer sanctions for violent offenders and to make sure we have the support to help keep communities safe with direct investments in law enforcement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889581">As set out in our 2025 electoral platform, our government is committed to strengthening the Criminal Code bail provisions to make it onerous to obtain bail for those charged with violent or organized crime related to auto theft, home invasion, trafficking in persons, human smuggling and drug trafficking. Our government is also committed to adding a requirement for courts to impose a firearms or weapons prohibition when granting bail to anyone charged with an organized crime-related offence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889582">Our government has committed to reforming Canada's sentencing regime to better address repeat and violent offending. More specifically, the 2025 electoral platform includes commitments to change the law to direct courts to give primary consideration to the principles of denunciation and deterrence when determining a sentence for anyone who has numerous convictions. That means courts would have to primarily consider a sentence that would deter repeat offenders. It includes commitments to broaden sentencing tools by allowing consecutive sentences for violent or organized crime-related auto theft. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889583">The <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> followed up on these electoral commitments when he agreed to strengthen the Criminal Code bail and sentencing laws during the June 2 first ministers meeting. Later that month, the <Affiliation DbId="318625" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> also announced publicly that bail and sentencing reforms will be forthcoming this fall to address growing concerns of repeat and violent offending at all stages of the criminal justice process. Over the summer, the Minister of Justice, the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> and I undertook significant engagement with the provinces and territories, law enforcement and legal stakeholders alike to inform and develop these reforms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889584">Now, although looking to future solutions is important, it is equally important to look to the past and to properly understand our criminal justice system and the current state of the law. For example, despite a persistent narrative that former Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> was soft on crime, I want to highlight that it explicitly strengthened the Criminal Code bail provisions as they relate to intimate partner violence. Former Bill C-75 made it more onerous for individuals previously convicted of intimate partner violence to obtain bail. This change was based on research suggesting that victims of intimate partner violence face a higher risk of violence from their intimate partners after charges are laid. This was a critical step in recognizing the unique risks posed by repeat offenders in intimate partner violence cases and in ensuring that survivors are protected.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8889585">More recently, in 2023, Parliament unanimously enacted former Bill <Document DbId="12426046" Type="3">C-48</Document> in response to a new and pressing challenge: growing concerns about repeat violent offending involving firearms and other weapons at the bail stage. The former Bill C-48 amendments were not developed in isolation. They too were the result of extensive collaboration with the provinces and territories. They also responded directly to calls for reform from premiers across the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889586">Among other changes, former Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> created a reverse onus at bail to better address the heightened public safety risks posed by those accused of repeat violent offending with firearms and other weapons. That meant that violent offenders with firearms now had to prove they deserve bail, as opposed to the previous process through which the Crown was having to prove why someone should not receive bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889587"> This presented a significant change that reflected the seriousness of this type of offending and the need to ensure that the courts would turn their minds to the unique public safety risks that those charged with this type of offending might present. Former Bill <Document DbId="12426046" Type="3">C-48</Document> also strengthened the intimate partner violence reverse onus. The bill expanded the reverse onus to also apply to anyone who had been previously discharged, and not just those convicted, of an offence involving intimate partner violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889588">Before moving on to what the government has committed to doing, I want to address another area of criminal law that generates significant commentary: conditional sentence orders, or CSOs. A CSO is a sentence that allows an offender to serve a term of imprisonment in the community under certain conditions. They are only available when the sentence is less than two years and when the court determines that it does not pose a risk to public safety or conflict with sentencing principles. CSOs cannot be imposed for offences that involve mandatory minimums, terrorism, criminal organization offences with indictable minimums of 10 years or more, advocating genocide, torture or attempted murder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889589">The current CSO rules stem from former Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document>, which was presented in 2022. This bill strictly made mention that courts may only impose CSOs when consistent with community safety and sentencing principles. CSOs must remain proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the offender's responsibility, and provide adequate denunciation and deterrent. The government has heard concerns that CSOs have been increasingly used for sexual offences in some lower courts. Even though appellate courts hold that they rarely represent proportionate sentences, our government continues to monitor the impacts of former Bill C-5 and will consider further refinements to ensure community safety and public confidence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889590">As crime evolves, so must our laws. This is why the <Affiliation DbId="318625" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> will be advancing additional bail and sentencing reforms this fall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889591">I would now like to turn to an aspect of our bail system that often gets overlooked, and that is the matter of shared responsibility between federal and provincial and territorial governments. While federal legislation sets the laws governing bail, the effectiveness of our bail system depends largely on how it is administered. Provinces are responsible for appointing provincial judges and judges who conduct most bail hearings, who are in some provinces are called justices of the peace; overseeing the operation of police services, which are responsible for supervising individuals who are released on bail; and enforcing any conditions of release.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889592">Provincial investments in community-based supports and supervision programs to reduce the risk of reoffending at the bail stage are also critical to ensuring that our bail system works as intended. Provinces and territories also hold the key to improving our understanding of bail outcomes. Right now, the provinces do not keep the bail data needed to ascertain whether our bail system is failing. Provincial leadership in improving data collection, and reporting is necessary to ensure effective evidence-based law reform at the federal level. It is an issue that I have brought up with every provincial representative I have met. Bail data will be crucial in understanding the fight against the cracks in our bail system.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8889593">In my speech so far, I have addressed several areas where reverse onuses have been imposed, such as cases involving firearm-related offences. We have yet to know whether that has had a positive impact or not. I fear, as we continue to make other reforms, that perhaps we may not understand fully whether they are having the impact Parliament intends.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889594">Further to that, the provinces administer the bail courts. Earlier this year, Brampton mayor Patrick Brown, on behalf of Ontario's Big City Mayors, wrote a letter to the Province of Ontario sounding the alarm on cases being withdrawn, discharged or dismissed. It was almost over 50% of cases. This is shocking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889595">Highlighting the need for more Crown attorneys to try these cases more quickly, more judges to hear them and more spaces in jails to put criminals away is crucial. Comprehensive criminal justice reform must include all levels of government coming to the table and doing their part. We are ready to do our part and to work with the provinces and territories that are ready to do theirs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889596">The changes I mentioned will help with our immediate issues, but if we are serious about reducing crime and seeing improvements of public safety, we must look beyond our criminal law system as well. Public safety begins with prevention. It requires supporting our youth, investing in communities and addressing the social conditions, including poverty, addiction, mental health and housing. Bail reform is but one piece of the complex puzzle. Lasting change requires a broader commitment to equity, opportunity and support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889597">All orders of government must work together to build an effective justice system that distinguishes between those who pose a genuine risk and those who can be safely managed in the community. People in Canada deserve a justice system that protects them all. They deserve laws that are clear, consistent and effective. They also deserve a justice system that works and that is firm but fair. They also deserve a government that listens, responds and acts, and we will do exactly that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889598">I also want to make mention of the opposition finally showing a shred of common sense, though it is long overdue. In Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document>, which is mentioned in today's motion, the Conservatives quietly removed the reckless American-style, far right, three-strike scheme they ran on in the last election. Empty slogans based on sporting rules will not foster a robust criminal system and keep Canadians safe. Canadians deserve real solutions that are guided by working collaboratively with law enforcement, attorneys and other levels of government. That is exactly what our comprehensive bill would do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889599">I pause here to comment on the way this motion is drafted. It claims that the Liberal government promised to pass criminal justice reform six months ago but has failed to do so. That is strange. Just last week, we introduced Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, the combatting hate act, which includes targeted Criminal Code provisions to address hate crimes, which are on the rise. The bill passed second reading yesterday evening on a deferred division and is now heading to committee for further study.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889600">Over the summer, the <Affiliation DbId="318625" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> has been hard at work studying ways to improve our laws by consulting closely with his provincial counterparts, law enforcement, police chiefs and police associations. Meanwhile, the Conservative <Affiliation DbId="322132" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> was busy fighting for his own job and then parachuted into Alberta, after being catastrophically rejected by Canadians across the country and in his own former riding of Carleton. However, it seems he has not learned any lessons from that rejection. He continues to act recklessly, prioritizing political posturing over meaningful, evidence-based criminal justice reform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889601">Let us reject slogans and oversimplifications. Slogans such as “jail not bail” may sound tough, but they do not get us any closer to solving the problem. Real solutions require real work. They involve strengthening laws, improving enforcement, investing in data, devoting resources to addressing the root cause of crime and ultimately building a justice system that works for everyone.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="00">(1100)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8889602">Let us embrace real solutions that are evidence-based, collaborative and grounded in the values of fairness and accountability. That is the path forward. That is the commitment of the government. That is what Canadians deserve and expect.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889606">Mr. Speaker, even today the tertiary principles, which were mentioned by a colleague on the Conservative side as well, apply when providing bail. Judges and justices of the peace should be considering public safety first and foremost. They should also be considering whether somebody is a flight risk and the confidence the public has in the judicial system. Those are very important basic foundational principles for deriving a decision on bail. Of course, there are other considerations they take into account, but public safety is the first and ought to be foremost. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889607">Although I cannot really comment on what happened in that case exactly, and I do not know why the judge would make such a decision, I think it is import to recognize that these decisions are made at the provincial courthouses.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889609">First, my colleague raised the issue of sexual crimes. We are currently studying a report on gender-based crimes in the Standing Committee on the Status of Women. The report discusses the fact that women are victims of violence, but also addresses the fact that they are victimized again by these time limits that are so unreasonable that their attackers can get off scot-free because of the Jordan decision. Witnesses have brought this up. The Bloc Québécois tabled a bill on this issue to ensure that someone accused of a sexual offence or an offence against women cannot get away with it by invoking the Jordan decision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889610">My colleague then spoke about court delays. She mentioned Crown attorneys, but the federal government is in no position to lecture anyone; it has been dragging its feet on the appointment of judges. The criteria are even rather questionable at times. For example, a judge who is an anti-secularism activist was appointed to the Quebec Superior Court even though he did not have the required 10 years of experience. This goes against the Canadian Judges Act, which requires much more than that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889637">Today we have before us a Conservative motion asking us to proceed with an expeditious study of a bill that attacks the most fundamental rights of our fellow citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889638">Who in the House protects every person's right to liberty? Who in the House protects every person's right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty under the law in a fair and public trial by an independent and impartial court? Who in the House protects every person's right not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause? We will do that. The Bloc Québécois will oppose this Conservative motion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889639">We have several reasons for doing so. Firstly, expediting the study of a bill that threatens our fundamental freedoms would represent a departure from democracy and a dereliction by the legislature of its duties, which we will fight against. Secondly, the Conservative bill also proposes some superficial amendments to the Criminal Code that would change nothing. Thirdly, the Conservative bill is inconsistent with sections of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and as such it raises constitutional questions that call at the very least for serious study.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889640">Before detailing our reasons, I would like to say a few words about the sense of insecurity that some of our fellow Quebeckers may be feeling and that the Conservative Party is trying to exploit. Of course, every time a crime makes the headlines, we are all shocked and outraged. When the news broke yesterday of the murder of a gangster who was gunned down in broad daylight in a Laval coffee shop, that was exactly our reaction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889641">It should be pointed out that when they are arrested, the suspects will not be released. The Criminal Code already stipulates that anyone charged with murder must remain in custody while awaiting trial. Still, the feelings of insecurity among some of our fellow citizens is understandable. We in the Bloc Québécois are proposing a number of measures to tackle criminal organizations, such as establishing an organized crime registry, similar to the terrorist entities list. This would make it easier to prove cases where a crime is committed for the benefit of a criminal organization. We also propose facilitating the seizure of assets by means of a reverse onus, to prevent the depletion of assets when an individual belonging to an organized crime group is arrested. In addition, we propose prohibiting criminal organizations from wearing their emblems or symbols. Right now, criminal organizations parade around with total impunity and actively promote their organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889642">We are calling for the creation of a specific offence to criminalize the recruitment of young people into crime. As we saw recently in Quebec, this has become the new modus operandi for organized crime. This is ruining lives and destroying families and we must get tougher with those who are exploiting our youth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889643">In response to legitimate security concerns, the Conservatives are calling for a jail not bail act. Some people might find this reassuring. However, imagine if a police officer arrests someone and accuses them of committing a crime. Even if this person says they did not commit the crime, they will be put into prison where they will spend many months in remand pending trial before they can prove their innocence. Does this still feel reassuring?</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8889644">If the government puts more people in jail before they are found guilty, do people still feel more secure, or does that rather open the door to a new form of insecurity and the risk that one could end up in jail on trumped-up charges for a crime they did not commit? That is what the Conservative bill is all about. It is an attack on the right to liberty and the right to the presumption of innocence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889645">I would like to come back to my reasons. First, we are being asked to fast-track this bill. The motion actually calls for an “expeditious...study”. Obviously, we do not agree with that. We will not pass a bill that attacks our fundamental freedoms under closure. They will plead urgency, but if we fast-track a bill that will result in greater injustice rather than greater justice, can we really say we served the common good?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889646">Second, certain aspects of the Conservative bill are nothing more than cosmetic changes. I will not get into the specifics. Nevertheless, I would like to point out that the bill seeks to amend subsection 515(10), which provides guidance for judges when determining whether or not to release an accused person. We are being told that public protection must be one of the criteria, but it already is. As I learned during my legal studies, normally, “Parliament does not speak in vain”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889647">For the record, but also to enlighten the House, subsection 515(10) of the Criminal Code already sets out the circumstances in which an accused may be detained. An accused is a person who has not yet been convicted. Anyone can see why it is important to have those criteria in place: charges may prove to be false. Sometimes the police receive complaints that turn out to be unfounded. It always comes back to the presumption of innocence. The basic premise of our criminal justice system is that the state must avoid perpetrating an injustice, even if that means some cases are not brought to justice. That is how our justice system works. It would rather prevent injustice than act too hastily.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889648">The Criminal Code already stipulates that accused persons are typically released unless they are accused of serious crimes, in which case they can be detained. That is possible under the current system. We have to fight this idea that our system is a revolving door: arrest people, give them a slap on the wrist, let them go so they can commit more crimes and then see them again two days later. That is not how it works.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889686">Mr. Speaker, the question raised by our Conservative colleagues' motion is of particular concern to me today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889687">The body of a young woman, Gabie Renaud, was discovered in my riding this week. I offer my deepest condolences to her family. I must say, I am shocked and dismayed by this incident. Her partner, the man who allegedly killed her, was on his 16th parole violation. I do not get it. I think we need to change the way things are done. This is unacceptable to me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889688">This is not the only case. Earlier today, I read that another woman in Saint‑Charles‑sur‑Richelieu was murdered yesterday. It is endless. We cannot just sit back and do nothing in the face of incidents like this. We have to get to work and find solutions. I am in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889689">What are the solutions? Our colleague from the Conservative Party is proposing one solution. I thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="318063" Type="2">Gaspésie—Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Listuguj</Affiliation> for his intervention, which was just before mine. He said it very well. The bill has not yet been introduced. We cannot say at this point that we are in favour of a bill that we have not read, since it has not been introduced, but that should be introduced eventually and should close certain loopholes. It does not work like that. We must do things in the right order if we want to be effective. The Bloc Québécois cannot support the Conservative motion today. That being said, again, there is great concern, and it affects us all. We are deeply troubled by situations like this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889690">Now, I am not ready to give up on the principle of the presumption of innocence. I believe that it is essential in a free and democratic society. I would not want to live in a society where a person is presumed guilty until proven innocent. That happens in other parts of the world, but I do not want that here. The presumption of innocence may cause turmoil and suffering, but it is my humble opinion that we would have even more turmoil and suffering if the presumption of innocence did not exist. We should not get rid of it. As the saying goes, let us not throw out the baby with the bathwater. The bathwater does need to be changed, though.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889691">My colleague from Gaspésie—Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Listuguj also spoke about criminal organizations. I have been in this House for 10 years, and I am about to table my third bill aimed at combatting criminal organizations by creating a registry of criminal organizations with associated consequences, such as a reverse onus for the seizure of property and a ban on support and displays of support for such organizations. It would be similar to the list of terrorist organizations, which is working well. We should copy that idea and use it to fight organized crime effectively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889692">It is true that femicides like the ones I was talking about are not related to organized crime, but this registry would be one way to fight crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889693">With regard to religious exemptions, we saw such an incident again last year when a preacher was shouting something like, “Allah, kill all the Jews and don't spare a single one”. That kind of thing has absolutely no place in a society like ours. How can anyone look at that situation and decide that nothing can be done? Come on. That is our job. We need to address this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889694">We agree with the Jordan decision and the principle of trial within a reasonable time. I agree with that. It does not make sense for someone to wait 10 years to be found guilty or innocent of the crime they were charged with. There are strict time limits. The Supreme Court examined all that and introduced time limits in the Jordan decision. Yes, they must be complied with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889695">Unfortunately, the provinces do not have the money to comply. They do not have enough courtrooms, judges and personnel to hold trials within the time limits. More money must be invested in the justice system. I often say that too. Justice is the backbone of a society. If people are denied justice through the courts, they will take matters into their own hands. That will lead to anarchy. We do not want that either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889696">It is important to respect the Jordan time limits, but to do that, the federal government will have to appoint judges and fill vacancies within a reasonable time. That is something else we are going to tackle.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8889697">Money also has to be transferred to the provinces so that they can administer justice more fairly and be more efficient when it comes to laying charges and proceeding to trial. The federal government also has a part to play in that. The health transfers to the provinces are unsatisfactory, and the same goes for the transfers for education and justice. When is this going to be fixed? When are changes going to be made in the way money is spent here to ensure that it goes where it is most needed, namely to the management of provincial institutions like the health system, the education system and the justice system? All of that is important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889698">Concerning bail, a solution has to be found, as I was saying. I do not know the exact figures, but at least 90% of femicides are committed by men. That is shocking, shameful, disturbing, troubling, and any number of other qualifiers one may care to add. However, my colleague was right to say earlier that of all the clients he represented as a defence lawyer, not one of them had read the Criminal Code before committing a crime. I do not imagine anyone is surprised by that. It should be obvious. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889699">Yes, we can add provisions to the Criminal Code, but above all, we must act. We must act by being more vigilant. Why are repeat offenders being released when the Criminal Code already states that public safety has to be taken into consideration in bail decisions? I have not read any of these cases in particular, but I am sure the judges are not stupid. If they decided to release these individuals, they must have had good reasons. I would be interested in finding out what they are, but there must have been reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889700">In that case, what can we do? We can, of course, tighten the criteria for release, but the question would be how to do that. The Conservatives want to invert the principle and switch from the presumption of innocence to the presumption of guilt. There has to be some space between the two. Reason should be able to navigate between these two principles. I encourage everyone to give this matter more thought.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889701">There is also the issue of minimum sentences. Our Conservative colleagues keep coming back to this issue. As the Supreme Court has found, adding minimum sentences to just about everything in the Criminal Code is unconstitutional. The government had to backtrack on this matter. The previous government had to reverse what the government before it had done. I hope we will not be playing this game forever, constantly going back and forth depending on which party is in power. We need to find a reasonable path forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889702">I have tried to make suggestions in the past. For instance, I proposed that when a minimum sentence is established for a certain crime in order to send a clear message to the public, courts should still have the option to choose a different sentence in exceptional circumstances. If, for any reason, a judge hears evidence during a trial and determines that a minimum sentence is not the most appropriate penalty, he or she could depart from that provision of the law. The judge could therefore waive the minimum sentence. That is one possible compromise, but not the only one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889703">I came up with a compromise, and I am not the only one with ideas. I am sure we can come up with others. We need creative solutions to move forward, instead of constantly going back and forth, which gets us nowhere and undermines public trust. It is certainly not the best way to convince criminals to stop committing crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889704">I have just said a lot in a short time. As I said, it troubles me and makes me uncomfortable when I see crimes like the ones that have happened this week. I am thinking, for one, of the unfortunate crime against Gabie Renaud in Saint‑Jérôme, in my riding of Rivière-du-Nord. It is so difficult. I feel completely useless. I cannot understand why we have not been able to make progress sooner and prevent situations like this. I hope we can work on it, but unfortunately, our Liberal colleagues will have to agree to revisit the principles they have established, and our Conservative colleagues will have to agree to revisit theirs. We must stop shifting from the presumption of innocence to the presumption of guilt. Justice and common sense must find a balance between the two. </ParaText>

As I said earlier, I believe in the principles set out by the Supreme Court in the Jordan decision. They are essential and they must be preserved.

              <ParaText id="8889719">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Cloverdale—Langley City.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889720">I have to ask myself what we are even doing here, talking, talking, talking, when the measures that need to be taken are quite clear. Unfortunately, because of the dithering and the government that has been in power for the past 10 years, we now have laws that make our communities a lot less safe. Just ask the family of Gabie Renaud, who was brutally murdered in Saint-Jérôme a few weeks ago and whose body was just found. Just ask the family of Marylène Levesque, who was murdered in Quebec City five years ago by Eustachio Gallese while he was on unsupervised release. We are talking about numerous situations that could have been avoided, numerous deaths that could have been avoided.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889721"> The harsh reality is that right now, in Canada, streets that were once peaceful and quiet have become danger zones for too many families. Violent crime is up 55% under this Liberal government, and that figure is not a statistical abstraction, it is the horrendous reality of forgotten victims and broken communities. Homicides have increased by 29%, gun-related crime has more than doubled in many areas, and extortion is up 357%. We need only look at what is happening at restaurants in Montreal and Laval. They are being set on fire, and gangs are going in and extorting the owners, forcing them to pay protection money, known as <I>pizzo</I>. Nothing is being done to help these restaurant owners get out of this situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889722"> What is happening at the moment is no accident. It is the direct result of the laws put in place by the Liberal government. We have spoken at great length about Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document>, which allows dangerous criminals to serve their prison sentence at home, and Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, the bill that brings us here again today and that makes it far too easy to get bail. It is spelled out in the law. Judges do not even have a choice. Dangerous criminals are automatically released.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889723">I am not even talking about what has been done in terms of managing parole. Members may recall that after the murder of Marylène Levesque in Quebec City, I got a motion passed asking the Standing Committee on Public Safety to investigate what happened at the Parole Board. The board had undergone a complete purge, particularly the members from Quebec, who were a bit too conservative for the government. They were replaced by new members who had very little experience, if any, and who were primarily chosen for their very left-leaning, very woke ideology. As a result, decisions were made, in particular the decision to release Eustachio Gallese on parole, as is the case currently with Jonathan Blanchet, the man who killed Gabie Renaud. This guy was arrested 30 times and released 16 times under certain conditions. However, he violated those conditions, yet there were no consequences. How can a person violate the conditions of his release 16 times and still be free? It makes no sense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889724">Once again, we are seeing an increase in crime. In Montreal, for example, assaults and domestic violence are on the rise. Across Quebec, sex crimes have increased by 20% in just two years. Child pornography cases have doubled. Organized crime is even spreading to the regions, recruiting young people into a brutal cycle that no one in this Liberal government seems interested in ending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889725">Today, we are debating a motion calling for Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document>, the jail not bail act, introduced by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="317835" Type="2">Oxford</Affiliation>, to be fast-tracked. We are asking that the bill be passed immediately and sent to committee in order to speed up the necessary legislative changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889726">We should keep in mind that the new <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been in office for six months.

              <ParaText id="8889728"> I am sharing my time with my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="318228" Type="2">Cloverdale—Langley City</Affiliation>, and I hope she will elaborate on that. We have some astonishing examples of problematic Liberal measures and promises made by a supposedly new government that was going to make a difference, but that is currently doing absolutely nothing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889729"> We are not asking it to promise us the moon. We just want the government to stop. There are enough bills. We want the government to let us pass them quickly to bring about change. Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document> can be dealt with if the House accepts it today. We can get that done and move forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889730">The government is not doing anything even though we are ready to move more quickly to prevent more deaths. Right now, criminals on bail or parole are laughing their heads off and doing as they please. Who pays the price? It is victims of domestic violence, women who are scared to leave their homes. Even if they stay at home, criminals have no qualms about coming back to assault them or worse, kill them. That is not acceptable in 2025 in a country like Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889731">We went through problems a few years ago because of Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document>, which introduced house arrest. The bill was intended to empty the prisons, and it was introduced by David Lametti, a former minister of justice who is going to become an ambassador, though I do not know to what country. Bill C‑5 was brought forward on the grounds that there were too many Black, racialized and indigenous people in prison. The intent was to narrow the scope of the Criminal Code so that fewer of these people would go to jail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889732">The first person to take advantage of Bill C‑5 after it came into force was a white man from Montreal who had committed aggravated sexual assault against his ex. Instead of going to prison, he got to sit at home watching Netflix. That is how things started, and the number of similar cases only grew. With Bill C‑5, Montreal's street gangs could rest easy. They knew that they would not go to prison if they were arrested but would instead get to stay at home doing whatever they wanted. We spoke out against this from the very beginning. We voted against the bill even before it was passed, and we said that it was not going to work. A few years have passed, and sure enough, we are now seeing the result.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889733">Two and a half years ago, I tabled Bill <Document DbId="12269389" Type="4">C‑325</Document>, which aimed to reverse Bill C‑5. There were also provisions in Bill C‑325 requiring that criminal charges be brought against a person who fails to comply with their release conditions. Unfortunately, this was defeated by our Liberal colleagues, with support from the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889734">I must compliment the Bloc Québécois, which initially supported Bill C‑5 but then realized its mistake. The Bloc Québécois voted with me in support of Bill C‑325. Ultimately, Bill C‑325 was defeated by the Liberals and the NDP. As a result, Bill C‑5 is still in effect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889735">There was Bill C‑5 and Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>. Today we are talking about the content of Bill C‑75. We are talking about the bill brought forward by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="317835" Type="2">Oxford</Affiliation>, Bill C‑242. It can be confusing when all these numbers are flying around, but what members need to understand is this. No one can understand how a person can be arrested and then be released three hours later to start committing crimes again. No one can understand why that law was enacted. That is the reason for Bill C‑242. We want to undo all of that and restore a justice system that is acceptable to and accepted by the population, who is asking for no more than that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889736">When we see women like Gabie Renaud murdered by a man who was charged 30 times and who violated his release conditions 16 times, it is impossible to understand how he was able to go and kill Gabie. It is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889737">We are basically lending a helping hand to this government, which does not seem to have the time to change course quickly. In six months, nothing has happened. We are putting bills forward. My colleague from Oxford has tabled a bill. Today's motion asks that we expedite the process and send this to committee in order to protect Canadians.</ParaText>

Instead of wedding bells, there were gunshots. Instead of safety, there was fear.

It chills a whole corridor of small businesses. Weddings get cancelled, bookings dry up and an entire community starts looking over its shoulder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889755">Here is the core failure: a legal environment that emboldens criminals. When the consequence for violent intimidation is a quick release, the message that sends is to keep going. Liberal Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>'s principle of restraint and Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document>'s repeal of mandatory jail time for serious gun crimes, including extortion with a firearm, have combined to lower the cost of terror for gangs and raised the cost of living for everybody else. The banquet hall was not just a building; it was supposed to be a safe place for families while the law did not protect it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889756">Then there is the tragic story of Tori Dunn. Tori is not just a name in the newspaper. She is a daughter, a friend. She is one of us, and she was attacked brutally by a man who never should have been free, a man with a record, a man known to police, a man who, under any system that valued the safety of women and the safety of families, would have been behind bars, but because of Liberal Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, he was not. He was out on bail, and Tori paid the price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889757">When I talk to people in my riding about Tori's story, they do not just shake their heads; they clench their fists and ask how this could happen and how our justice system could look at his record and set him free. She was 30, an entrepreneur, a daughter and a friend, and she was brutally killed in her own home in Port Kells in 2024. Her murderer, Adam Mann, was already facing eight other charges, including aggravated assault, from just a week earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889758"> We do not need a law degree to see the pattern. The Liberals told the courts to restrain themselves, the courts complied, a dangerous man was back in the community, a young woman is dead and her family is left asking how a system could see the risk and choose release.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8889759">This is not complicated. When Parliament says to err on the side of release, people like Tori carry the risk. This is not just about Tori, though. It is about every woman who wonders if she is safe walking home at night. It is about every parent who wonders if their daughter will make it home. It is about whether the justice system values the safety of our families or the comfort of repeat offenders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889760">Let me tell members about something else that happened just down the road from my place in the heart of Langley. It was early morning, June 1, on the Fraser Highway. The sun had barely risen. A woman was standing by the curb, when out of nowhere she was shoved into the street. She fell really hard, and before she could even get her bearings, she was kicked and punched again and again. All of it was captured on video. This was not a scuffle. This was not a misunderstanding. It was a brutal, unprovoked attack. The man responsible, Hugh Mason, is no stranger to police. He is already known for violence and already known for breaching the law, yet he was there on our streets free to lash out at an innocent woman.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889761">Here is what makes this hit home even worse for me. This was not just any street corner. This was steps away from the seniors home built by my own church community, the home where my grandparents lived. It is filled with seniors who worked a lifetime, who built this country and who should be able to walk outside without fear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889762">Imagine the conversations after that crime, with seniors asking their grandchildren to walk them to the pharmacy because they do not feel safe alone. That is not the Canada they helped build. That is not the promise they earned, yet here we are because a bail system tilted in favour of the offender gave another chance to a man who had already burned through all his chances, and because Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, by the Liberals, told judges to restrain themselves, even when restraint meant danger for everybody else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889763">This is what catch-and-release looks like in real life. It is not just a line in a bill, but fear in the eyes of our grandmothers and grandfathers, our opas and omas. That fear, my friends, is something we have the power and the responsibility to end.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889764">At the end of the day, this is not about politics. It is not about left and right. It is about whether a mom can walk her child to school without fear, whether a small business owner can open his doors without an extortionist calling at midnight and whether a senior, like our omas and opas, can sit on a porch without looking over their shoulder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889765">The Conservatives have put forward the jail not bail act, not because it sounds good on paper but because it puts people first. It says that public safety is the priority. It says that if a person commits a major crime, like pulling a gun, breaking into a home or assaulting their neighbour, they do not just stroll back onto the streets the next day. This bill would tip the scales back to where they belong. It restores balance. It protects victims. It puts common sense back at the heart of justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889766">I say to the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that if he is serious about restoring peace to our communities, he will back the bill. He will correct his <Affiliation DbId="318625" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation>, and he will reverse his party's failed bail laws, because Canadians deserve better than ideology. They deserve safety.</ParaText>

The tragedy of our current system is that it only takes one case to devastate a family or a community.

Right now, judges are told to start from the principle of restraint, which tilts the balance away from public safety. That is not the fault of the judiciary.

Judges need a law that lets them keep dangerous people behind bars, which is what our bill would deliver. It is a framework built on common sense, not catch and release.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889786"> I will begin by speaking about Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document>, the jail not bail act, which was introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="317835" Type="2">Oxford</Affiliation>. Bill C‑242 includes provisions to expand the reverse onus provisions for serious offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889787">I am pleased to see that there is common ground between the Conservative opposition and our new Liberal government, which was elected on a promise to crack down on repeat and violent offenders. Our election promise responds to a concern shared by many Canadians that individuals who pose a serious risk to public safety should not be released without rigorous judicial oversight. It also reflects the desire to ensure that the bail system takes into account concerns about reoffending and violent offences that communities across the country have raised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889788">However, while Bill C‑242 aims to overcome fears that individuals who pose a risk to public safety will be released without judicial oversight, the way it is drafted raises serious concerns about whether these measures could actually be effective and whether they comply with the fundamental principles of justice and proportionality.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8889789">There seems to be one crucial element that is clearly missing from this bill. Frankly, I am, at the very least, relieved. It seems the Conservatives have finally opened their eyes because they have flip-flopped on the controversial “three strikes” proposal. This kind of rhetoric may score political points, but, in reality, it solves absolutely nothing. Everywhere it has been applied, particularly in the United States, it has failed and has been ineffective at protecting citizens or reducing crime. It seems the Conservatives have finally realized this, as they chose not to include it in their own bill, Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889790">However, this flip-flop raises fundamental questions. The Conservatives owe Canadians an explanation. They need to tell Canadians why they have changed their minds and publicly acknowledge that this proposal was not only misguided but also dangerous. Canadians deserve a clear answer. They deserve to know why an idea inspired by the far right in the United States, entirely incompatible with Canadian realities and our justice system, was ever even considered acceptable by the same people who claim to prioritize public safety and the public interest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889791">Therefore, I hope, following my remarks, a member of the opposition will rise and offer an explanation and perhaps even an apology to Canadians. Yes, they could offer an apology for even considering such legislation inspired by foreign, far right, extreme models rather than laws designed for Canada and made in Canada, laws that reflect our communities, our values and our justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889792">Let us now take a sombre look at the Conservative record when it comes to criminal justice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889793">In 2008, the Harper government passed the Tackling Violent Crime Act, imposing a mandatary minimum sentence for firearm offences. The Supreme Court struck this down in R v. Nur, calling it “cruel and unusual”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889794">In 2012, they doubled down with the Safe Streets and Communities Act, extending mandatory minimums for drug offences. In R v. Lloyd, again, the Supreme Court struck this down. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889795">In 2009, they pushed through the so-called Truth in Sentencing Act, limiting judicial discretion on credit for pre-trial custody. In R v. Safarzadeh-Markhali, it was struck down again for being overbroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889796">In 2011, they introduced the Protecting Canadians by Ending Sentence Discounts for Multiple Murders Act. The Supreme Court invalidated it in R v. Bissonnette, ruling that stacked parole ineligibility violated human dignity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889797">In 2013, they passed legislation making the victim surcharge mandatory and non-waivable. In R v. Boudreault, the court ruled it “unconstitutional” and “cruel and unusual” for the poorest and most marginalized offenders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889798">Most recently, the mandatory minimum for reckless discharge of a firearm, another Harper-era invention, was struck down in R v. Hills in 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889799">The list goes on, but allow me to focus on the real action that the new Liberal government is taking. Most recently, Canadians sent the federal government a clear message. They are concerned about repeat and violent offenders and want to see urgent action. This is why the new Liberal government is firmly committed to introducing a bill this fall that will build on previous legislative reforms to strengthen Canada's bail and sentencing laws. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889800">This forthcoming legislation will once again be shaped by strong intergovernmental co-operation. This renewed collaboration among the federal, provincial and territorial governments reflects a shared commitment to public safety and a recognition that meaningful change depends on coordinated action across jurisdictions. By working together, our governments can ensure that our bail laws are not only stronger on paper but effective in practice.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889801">The provinces and territories also play a vital role in collecting and sharing bail data. Leadership in these areas is essential to improving the system as a whole. Bail data collection does not occur at the national level. This responsibility falls to provincial and territorial governments. Without consistent and comprehensive data from all jurisdictions, it is difficult to assess how bail laws are working, what gaps exist, and what changes are needed.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8889802">Canadians deserve a bail system that protects communities while respecting rights. They deserve a sentencing regime that holds offenders accountable while promoting rehabilitation. They deserve to see all orders of government working together not just to pass laws but to implement them in ways that make a real difference in the lives of all Canadians.

However, Quebec has long been asking to have its say on the judges Ottawa appoints to sit on higher courts, such as the Quebec Superior Court and the Quebec Court of Appeal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889812">As members know, the Liberals recently appointed lawyer and Liberal supporter Robert Leckey as a judge, even though he is against secularism and had not even been a member of the Barreau du Québec for the 10 years required before being appointed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889813">When will the Liberals finally realize that the situation could be improved by perhaps allowing Quebec to participate in the judicial appointment process, or at least in the recommendation process?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889821">Mr. Speaker, Canadians are worried about crime in their communities, and let me be clear at the outset: The concerns are valid. When Canadians see stories of violent incidents in their neighbourhoods and when they hear about repeat offenders cycling in and out of the system, it shakes their confidence. It makes families wonder whether their kids are safe walking home from school, whether seniors are safe going to the grocery store and whether their communities are as secure as they once were.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8889822">We must never brush these concerns aside or suggest to Canadians that it is all in their heads or that they should not be concerned. The truth is that violent crime is a problem. Recidivism is a problem. Canadians expect us, as legislators, to seriously and urgently respond to this problem with solutions, not slogans.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8889823">The motion before us today tries to frame the issue in very simple terms. It says crime is up 55%, repeat offenders are on the streets and the solution is to pass one bill, Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document>, the so-called jail not bail act. While it may be politically convenient for the Conservatives to package such a complex issue into a single slogan, Canadians know that public safety is much more complicated than that.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8889824">I would like to remind the House of what has already been accomplished. In 2023, under a Liberal government, Parliament passed significant bail reforms. These reforms specifically targeted violent repeat offenders, including those charged with serious offences involving firearms. We heard the concerns of provincial and territorial premiers and police associations, and we took action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889825">These reforms tightened the rules to make it more difficult for individuals charged with serious violent crimes to get bail. This was not just a slogan; it was action.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8889826">I am standing here to suggest that the work is not finished; it is far from it. In fact during the most recent election, Canadians gave the new Liberal government a fresh mandate to go further. Our platform was clear. We committed to strengthening bail again where it is failing, we committed to ensuring that prosecutors and judges have the resources they need, and we committed to making new investments in victim services and community safety programs. That is the plan Canadians voted for. That is the plan we are implementing in the current session of Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889827">The Conservatives would like Canadians to believe that bail is the entire story, but public safety is not just about what happens at a bail hearing. Public safety is about prevention, prosecution and protection, and our government is acting on all these fronts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889828">Let me take a moment to talk about prosecution. One of the real challenges we face is that Crown prosecutors in courts are overburdened. Cases take too long, and dangerous offenders sometimes slip through the cracks, not because of soft laws but because of an under-resourced system. That is why our platform committed to increasing resources for Crown attorneys so they can prepare cases more effectively, so they can oppose bail where necessary and so they can ensure that trials move forward without unnecessary delay.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889829">That is also why we are expanding resources for judges. Judges need the ability to impose strict release conditions when they believe someone poses a risk to public safety. They need the time and the capacity to make those decisions thoughtfully, and we are giving them those tools.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8889830">Let us now turn to prevention. If we want to permanently reduce crime, we cannot focus solely on punishment; we also have to focus on prevention. Our platform was clear on this. We are committed to expanding programs to help youth build better lives and steer them away from gangs and crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889831">We are committed to strengthening mental health and addiction services because we know that untreated mental health and untreated addictions cause many people to reoffend. We are committed to the building safer communities fund and to indigenous justice initiatives because we know that reconciliation and equity promote safety.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8889832">The motion before us ignores prevention completely. It ignores prosecution completely. It says the solution is one bill and longer sitting hours, but Canadians know that one bill would not make their neighbourhoods safer overnight. They know it takes a comprehensive plan, one that is done hand in hand with the people at the front line of implementing the laws we vote on in here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889833">Conservatives call it “catch and release”. We call it listening to Canadians and delivering real solutions, not slogans. Let me be clear: The government agrees that repeat violent offenders must be dealt with firmly. We agree that Canadians deserve to feel safe in their communities, and we are acting on that commitment. In fact, legislation to strengthen bail further will be coming forward in the current session. We have been very clear that this is the responsible path forward, and we have committed to protecting Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889834">However, we will not reduce the issue to a bumper sticker. We will not pretend that public safety can be restored by slogans, because Canadians have heard slogans before, and they voted to not be governed by slogans. They heard them during the decade the Conservatives were in power. The Conservatives had 10 years to act. They had 10 years in which they could have strengthened bail, resourced prosecutors and invested in prevention. They did not; they failed. Now suddenly, Conservatives have discovered slogans about jail, not bail, but Canadians are not looking for slogans. They are looking for solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889835">Let me remind the House what those solutions look like under a Liberal government. They look like targeted bail reform, which was passed in 2023, with more reforms coming in the current session. They look like investment in prosecutors and judges so the justice system works the way it should. They look like prevention programs for youth, addiction treatment programs and mental health supports that reduce crime before it happens. They look like stronger victim services, because safety also means standing with the people who have already been harmed. That is the Liberal plan. It is what we campaigned on, it is what Canadians voted and it is what we are delivering.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8889836">The motion before us today is not a genuine plan for public safety; it is a political tactic, a mere slogan. It is an attempt to persuade Canadians that all of the problems would solved, if only this bill were to pass.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889837">Canadians know better than that. They know that public safety is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive approach. They know that only the Liberal government will implement a comprehensive approach like this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889838">We must recognize the Canadians' concerns and accept the reality that crime is a problem. However, we must not give in to the politics of fear or political slogans. We have to do the heavy lifting involved in building a fair, firm and effective justice system, something that our government is committed to achieving. We intend to act on that commitment in the current session, which is why I cannot support this motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889861"> Under the Liberal government, since it has taken office, violent crime is up 55%, extortion is up 330%, homicides are up 29% and sexual assaults are up 76%. There is a cause and there is an effect. We know the source of this crime. It is Liberal bail, as passed into law by Liberal Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>. It requires judges to release the accused at the “earliest reasonable opportunity” on the “least onerous” restrictions. Those are the words embedded in the law.

He then went on to the housing portfolio, where he created the worst housing crisis in the OECD, and now he is in charge of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>

It was a plan that he was caught on tape saying would not work. This is who we have as the keystone cops in charge of reversing the Liberal crime wave of the last decade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889867">Some people say we need bail reform. We have bail reform. It is called Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>. What we need is to undo Liberal bail reform; hence today, we are calling for the government to scrap Liberal bail and replace it with jail, not bail. Today, we put forward a motion that would allow Parliament to adopt Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document>, the jail not bail act. It was put forward by the brilliant member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="317835" Type="2">Oxford</Affiliation>, Ontario. This proposal is backed by police, crime victims and everybody who wants to stop crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889868">The House will hear more from the member for <Affiliation DbId="318102" Type="2">Niagara South</Affiliation>, with whom I am splitting my time on this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889869">I will note that members of the government do not need to do a thing. They just need to get out of the way. They have already broken the bail system. They brought in the chaos we are now experiencing. We are not asking them to put on a cape and come to the rescue. We are asking them to simply get out of the way. If they do one thing, it should be to sit on their hands and let the House of Commons pass this motion to quickly push through the jail not bail act. We can lock up the criminals who have been terrorizing our streets. That is all we need them to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889870"> In fact, some people say they are doing nothing. It would be great if they did nothing, because nothing would be a massive improvement over what they have been doing, which is doing violence to our Criminal Code. Our Criminal Code has allowed criminals to do violence to our people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889871">The answer is actually very simple. Pseudo-intellectuals in Liberal circles love to say the problem is much more complicated. It is not a complicated problem. The statistics tell us the extent of it. We have a very small number of criminals doing a phenomenal amount of crime. The same 40 offenders in Vancouver got arrested 6,000 times. That is 150 arrests per offender per year, and those were just the occasions they were caught. Almost all of the crime is done by a tiny group of rampant reoffenders. If we keep them in jail, they cannot reoffend. It is very simple.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889872"> We did this under the previous Conservative government. One thing happened that was unsurprising and one that was maybe counterintuitive. The first thing, unsurprisingly, is that crime went down by 25%. It plummeted. It was the biggest drop in crime in modern Canadian history. It worked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889873">The second part was a bit counterintuitive. What else went down? It was incarcerations. After Liberals warned that we would have to build new jails to accommodate all of the prisoners, fewer people, in fact, ended up in jail. Why? It is because the same offenders who were coming in and going out just stayed behind bars. We had already reserved them a room. It was like the Hotel California, where they checked out but never really left. We kept them in the cell and never let them out. We locked them up and threw away the key.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889874">Something else happened. The small-time offenders or those looking to get involved in a life of crime said, “Hell, no. The penalty is too serious. I'm going to get a job and follow the law.” Deterrence works.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889875">The facts are in. Liberal bail has brought hell to our streets. The only one keeping that hell in place is the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He and his government need to get out of the way so Conservatives can scrap Liberal bail, lock up the criminals and throw away the key. Let us do this not out of vengeance or spite, but out of love for law-abiding people so that our children can once again play safely in our streets, so that people can go to bed at night in peace and tranquillity, so that when they wake up in the morning, their car is still there, and so that we have a safe country where law-abiding people can live good, secure, happy, worry-free lives. That is what we are working for. Will the government get out of the way and let us get it done?</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8889893">Mr. Speaker, I am proud to contribute to this debate and follow my leader, who has never wavered on the need for reform of the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889894">As a new MP, I am proud to stand here after several troubling weeks in my riding of Niagara South. I am proud to bring the voices of so many angry and frustrated people who have gathered to protest the vicious assault of a three-year-old toddler known to all of us now as little E.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889895">There might be a few of us here who grew up in the 1960s. When I was much younger, I remember Canada as a much different place. Our community was more respectful. We had few, if any, issues with feeling safe on our streets, and certainly we felt safe in our homes. We had rules and we followed them. Some here remember being able to roam our neighbourhoods with our friends, knowing that when the streetlights came on, we headed home, and we all made it home safely. Before cellphones, social media and algorithms, we rode our Mustang bikes with monkey handlebars and banana seats. In my community, we had a holdover from the Second World War. We called it the nine o'clock whistle. It was a curfew whistle that we heard around town, and that was our signal to go home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889896">I grew up in a family of law enforcement. My grandfather was chief of police in my small town of Port Colborne. My father was in the RCMP before joining the navy in World War II and later had a long career as a lawyer, Crown attorney and police commissioner. We respected our police, our teachers, our principals, our neighbours and our shopkeepers, and we always respected our elders. I know it sounds somewhat idyllic and even a bit like an episode of <I>Leave It to Beaver</I>, but this was the childhood I knew and remember with fond nostalgia. Yes, I watched <I>Leave It to Beaver</I> in black and white.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889897">Sadly, my nostalgic sentimentality for a safe community has evolved into fear and trepidation in navigating our streets. What went wrong? Before I look at this, I would like to update the House on the case that has captivated, mobilized and crystallized opinion about crime in my community, the case of that three-year-old little girl who was brutally and in the most reprehensible way sexually assaulted in her own home in the city of Welland. She was attacked by a convicted and recently released registered sex offender. For me and so many in my community, this can only be described as unbelievable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889898"> This took place in a neighbourhood in which I grew up. My grandparents owned a home on this street in Welland. As a child, I never felt unsafe in this neighbourhood. I would walk with my grandfather on Sunday mornings to pick up bread down the street at Barca's Bakery, and I would often be dispatched to pick it up myself. Again, I never felt unsafe, but little E, the sweet little three-year-old, will likely never feel safe again. After more than three weeks in the hospital recovering from this unspeakable assault, little E is now back home with her family.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889899">The House knows the story of Daniel Senecal. He was released early after being convicted of sexually assaulting a young boy. He is on the sex offender registry. He was released into my community early on parole, and within a few short weeks he reoffended, breaking into the home of this little girl. Little E did not deserve this. No little girl, no little boy, no human being should be subjected to this kind of vile act of sexual assault. This particular little girl did not deserve to spend three weeks in the hospital. Most critically, Daniel Senecal should have been in prison, not in the room of a three-year-old toddler.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889900">Daniel Senecal has a bail hearing on October 15. Yes, this repeat convicted offender and vile excuse for a human being has a bail hearing on October 15. Now, clearly, this is his charter right and right of due process. That is not in dispute. The problem is that he is appearing for bail in the first place when he should have been in jail serving his original sentence. If that were the case, little E would have been just another happy little girl growing up without fear of being attacked by a convicted sex offender within the confines of her own home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889901">I started a petition in my riding, hoping to bring the voice of my community to this chamber. Little did I know how far and wide the response would be. I will present the petition after the Easter break so the government hears the voices of tens of thousands of people in Niagara. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8889902">During the recent election campaign, people told me their stories and their fears about rising crime rates, violent crimes and the feeling that their community is no longer safe. They spoke to me about the absurd catch-and-release policy of the current Liberal government. Violent crime is up 55%. Crime across the board, from extortion to car theft and home invasions, is way up. The stats are clear, but the fear is palpable and real. The current Liberal approach of forcing judges to release offenders at the earliest possible opportunity, under the least onerous conditions, is an abomination. The phrase “catch-and-release”, for me, is a fishing term but is oddly reflective of the main problem in the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889903">Police have told me horror stories about the utterly useless policy of catch-and-release. One officer recently told me he had arrested the same individual 30 times over a period of several months in Niagara. In some situations, the same individual was released on the same day on a simple promise to appear. This is the new expedited process, a promise to appear. An arrest can be made with the perpetrator sitting in the back seat of a cruiser and let go on a promise to appear. This is both laughable and sad, but it happens every single day. I have heard that in some cases, police simply drive by rather than waste time on useless paperwork. They know that the process is fatally flawed and that people are never going to do time for their crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889904">When I asked the <Affiliation DbId="318625" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> about the case of little E, he told me that legislation is on the way. That is not good enough. It is not good enough for little E, and it certainly does not deal with the issue of early release for abhorrent predators who are sent back into our communities and neighbourhoods to offend over and over again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889905">Here we are. We have a promise of bail reform but no action. I fully expect the <Affiliation DbId="318625" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> will make good on his promise to introduce legislation, but will he actually change and reverse a decade of Liberal soft-on-crime catch-and-release and fundamentally reform our bail system? That remains to be seen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889906">To me, people like Daniel Senecal should never see the light of day again. This is not “three strikes and you're out”. Sexually assaulting a toddler should carry a sentence commensurate with the crime, which, in my opinion, means life. When someone steals the innocence of a toddler, they forfeit their right to ever walk the streets of any neighbourhood again, let alone to ever have contact with children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889907">The last time I spoke about this in the House, I had been visited by many survivors of sexual assault, often perpetrated by repeat offenders. They live in fear every single day. The list of people being released only to be convicted again is staggering. Several women sat in my office in Welland and tearfully told me their stories and about the scars they have and the fears they have, living every single day looking over their shoulder.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889908">Many know their perpetrators are somewhere out there, and they are afraid. They hide. They do not engage in events where their faces can be seen. However, a few had garnered the courage to speak out this time, knowing they were making themselves visible and vulnerable. Many continue to move from place to place out of sheer fear. They pleaded with me to bring their stories to the floor of the House of Commons, and I am so proud to do that today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889909">Let me conclude by taking a moment to talk to my community about the fear and frustration that has gripped all of us in my beautiful Niagara region. This is not a partisan issue. We cannot ignore that the Liberal government created this soft-on-crime catch-and-release, mandatory parole, applying an easy path for criminal activity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889910">Conservatives are committed to strengthening the Criminal Code and ensuring that people like Daniel Senecal would never have another chance to offend. We are here to make sure repeat offenders actually receive a sentence equal to their crime. Frankly, if it were up to me, he would rot in jail for the rest of his life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889911">I want to thank the people of Niagara South who signed the petition that I will present to the House shortly. To the survivors, I thank them for their courage to talk to me about the pain, the fear and the difficult path of recovery. They give me strength here, and I am grateful for their counsel and help in bringing this message forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889912">I implore the government to introduce legislation. There is no time to waste. It must bring in legislation now, not sometime in the fall but right now, so dangerous criminals like Daniel Senecal never hurt children again.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889928">Mr. Speaker, I am a proud representative of Mississauga—Lakeshore, and I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="317698" Type="2">Calgary Signal Hill</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889929">As I rise to debate the opposition motion before us, I want to talk particularly about its narrative and the appropriate steps moving forward. My community, like many communities, is concerned. We have a number of town halls. We have talk groups. We have ongoing discussions with Peel police. We understand the dilemmas that are before us, and we recognize the concerns our neighbours face. They are concerned about guns, home invasions and auto thefts. These things have become an issue of concern across the country. However, there is also a blame game that seems to be going on. Oftentimes, it deflects responsibility. We are all responsible for ensuring that our communities are safe, at the federal level, at the provincial level and at the municipal level, and even with some of the organizations and associations that are engaged. It is appropriate for us to have this ongoing debate and discussion. I welcome the fact that it is a non-partisan issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889930">There is organized crime. We have been in meetings with the RCMP, border security, international agencies and the police to ensure that organized crime is addressed. Organized criminals are perpetrating some of these criminal acts; they are engaging with our young people, who are victimized themselves by being sourced in order to do these criminal acts. This is why, just last month, we introduced Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, the combatting hate act, to address hate-motivated offences. This legislation successfully passed second reading yesterday, and it is now moving to committee for detailed study and consideration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889931">Over the summer, the <Affiliation DbId="318625" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> engaged in consultations with provincial and territorial counterparts, law enforcement agencies, police chiefs and associations to ensure that any reforms are practical, evidence-based and responsive to the needs of Canadians. This is how responsible reform happens, through careful study, collaboration and expert guidance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889932">Meanwhile, the <Affiliation DbId="322130" Type="2">Conservative leader</Affiliation>, who was preoccupied with keeping his job, has torqued the rhetoric, which is very partisan in its nature. While seeking his parachute return to the House after being resoundingly rejected by his constituents, he has now been more concerned for himself than for the public safety measures we are talking about. lnstead of focusing on measures that truly improve public safety, he continues to advance reckless, politically motivated proposals, prioritizing appearances over solutions that actually protect Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889933">Canadians deserve more than slogans and political theatre. They deserve government that listens, engages with experts and acts decisively to make communities safer. That is exactly what this government is doing, through legislation that addresses urgent issues while respecting the principles of justice and fairness. This is why the federal government has taken important steps to reform the bail system in recent years. ln 2023, former Bill <Document DbId="12426046" Type="3">C-48</Document> made meaningful changes to strengthen the bail system in response to concerns about efficiency and repeat offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889934">For example, Bill <Document DbId="12426046" Type="3">C-48</Document> created a reverse onus to target serious repeat offending involving weapons, and it expanded the list of firearms that trigger a reverse onus at bail. It also broadened the reverse onus targeting repeat offenders in cases of intimate partner violence. These changes made it more difficult for accused persons to obtain bail when they are charged with serious repeat offences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889935">All of us want to keep criminals in jail. All of us—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889937">
                <B>Charles Sousa:</B> Absolutely, I do. Mr. Speaker, I take offence to the very nature of that notion. The fact that individuals are suggesting any member of this Parliament would prefer not to put a criminal in jail is offensive in its own right. There are laws that are in place. There are laws that have been in place all along. We have to enforce the law. These changes were not the result of partisan initiatives. They were reflected by broad collaboration with provinces, territories, law enforcement and legal experts. Every step was guided by data, by evidence, by consultation with those working on the front lines of criminal justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889938">Despite these reforms, we understand that Canadians remain concerned about repeat offences and violent offences. This is why the government will introduce legislation this fall to further strengthen bail and sentencing provisions in the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8889939">The federal government has committed to establishing reverse onuses for a range of serious crimes, including violent and organized crime-related auto theft, home invasions, human trafficking and human smuggling, to make bail more onerous to obtain in these circumstances. There is also a commitment to amending the Criminal Code to direct courts to give primary considerations to the principles of denunciation and deterrence when determining a fit sentence for anyone who has numerous convictions for auto thefts or home invasions. Further commitments include expanding the possibility of consecutive sentences in violent or organized crime-related auto theft cases.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889940"> These are concrete measures aimed at addressing repeat and violent offending throughout the criminal justice process. They represent an approach that is strategic, evidence-based and evidence driven, and focused on protecting public safety without sacrificing the rights and fairness that are the foundational aspects of our judicial system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889941">We also know that reform cannot happen in isolation. The operation of the bail system is a shared responsibility between the federal and provincial and territorial governments, as I have already stated. While the federal government sets the legal framework, the provinces and territories manage the day-to-day operations, including court and jail administration. Strengthening the law at the federal level must therefore be complemented by effective enforcement resources and oversight at the provincial level, and without this coordination, even the best legislation would not achieve meaningful change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889942">Data and evidence also play a crucial role. Provinces and territories collect the data necessary to evaluate how bail laws are functioning, identify gaps and implement improvements. Better data always allows government to track outcomes, assess risks and ensure that measures designed to protect public safety are actually working. That is why our government continues to work closely with partners across the country to improve data collection, transparency and reporting in the criminal justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889943">Public safety is built through careful policy, strong partnerships and sustained action. It is not achieved through slogans and partisan posturing. It is built when governments work together to address the root causes of crime, including poverty, trauma, mental health issues and housing insecurity, as well as individuals not being given the support they need to rebuild their lives. Canadians deserve a bail system that protects communities while respecting rights, as well as sentencing systems that hold offenders accountable while promoting rehabilitation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889944"> This government is delivering on that promise. We are not acting in haste or based on politics; we are consulting with experts, collaborating with provincial counterparts and building laws that work in practice. We are introducing legislation to ensure that repeat offenders face appropriate consequences, that courts have the tools to protect public safety and that the justice system functions efficiently and fairly for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889945">In conclusion, Canadians expect a government that acts responsibly, listens to experts and delivers results. That is what we are doing with our justice reform agenda. We have introduced Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> to fight hate crime; we strengthened the bail system through Bill <Document DbId="12426046" Type="3">C-48</Document>, and we are preparing additional measures this fall to further address repeat and violent offences. That is not about political games or empty slogans; it is about real action, public safety and justice, and that is exactly the approach Canadians elected this government to take.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889946"> Laws exist, and we need to enforce them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889965">The reason the Conservative Party has brought forward Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document> is to help government members. Clearly, they are busy thinking about things, but they are not doing things, and Canadians require action. At this point in time, crime statistics are up throughout our country, from province to province, and we have to do something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889966">In August, just two months ago, I attended a meeting in Calgary with senior members of the Calgary Police Service. At that time, a superintendent described a circumstance that had occurred in Calgary in July that illustrates well the problem we have and the problem we must fix. The superintendent described a crime wave that took place in Calgary through the month of July that was identified by the police service. They responded, they put a task force together and they commenced making arrests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889967">A group of youths and young adults were committing home break-ins. However, very frighteningly to the police, who traditionally see criminals break into homes for the purpose of theft and focusing on times when homes are not occupied, this brazen group had been breaking into homes at night, with no consideration for whether the homes were occupied. Indeed, they seemed to prefer to break into homes that were occupied.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889968">An individual was caught red-handed, as the expression goes, in a home at night with the residents of the home there.

However, the same individual was arrested by the Calgary Police Service within a matter of days of his first arrest and released. Again, he was in a home unlawfully at night, with the residents of that home present. For a second time, this individual was taken before a justice of the peace and released. That might begin to shock the senses, but the fact is that this same individual was arrested for a third time within one week, again at night in a residence with the residents of that home present.

The idea that violent offenders could be released back onto our streets is terrifying—not just for us, but for every Canadian family. That night changed how we live and forced us to secure our home in ways I never imagined necessary. This will have a lasting impact on our family and our sense of safety. This legislation recognizes that public safety must come first. It sends a clear message that violent crime has real consequences, and that the rights of victims and families come before the rights of criminals.</QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="8889987">Mr. Speaker, undoubtedly, the prior regime in place before the Liberals broke Canada's bail system was one in which the rights of the public were considered in assessing the suitability for release of someone charged with a criminal offence. Of course we are talking about a very particular stage in our criminal justice process, a point in time when a person is charged but has not been tried and has not been found guilty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889988">However, when we consider past criminal behaviour as an aspect of the probability of reoffending, that consideration and the protection of the public must be part of the overall consideration our courts give to the option of bail or any other form of release.

              <ParaText id="8889989">Mr. Speaker, today I rise in the chamber to support Conservative Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document>, the jail not bail act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889990">I will be sharing my time with my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="317953" Type="2">Richmond Hill South</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889991">Canadians are tired of waking up to headlines that read like crime thrillers except that they are real and are happening in our neighbourhoods. In Brampton, families do not feel safe anymore. Crime is no longer the exception but is becoming the norm. Residents and communities are being impacted every day, with violent home invasions, daylight shootings, carjackings, sexual assaults and repeat offenders walking free. This is the result of Liberal catch-and-release justice and a broken bail system that puts criminals ahead of victims and communities. It is why I rise today in support of Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document>, the jail not bail act, a Conservative solution to restore law and order and to protect innocent Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889992">Let me share the statistics under the Liberal catch-and-release system. Homicides are up 29%, violent crime is up by 55%, sexual assaults have increased by 76%, extortion has surged by 330%, auto thefts are up by 25%, hate crimes are up by 258% and firearms crimes are up by 130%. These are not just numbers; these are real people, victims whose lives have been shattered by repeat violent offenders who should never have been released.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889993">In Markham, a 54-year-old man was left seriously injured in a violent home invasion. One of the suspects was already out on bail despite facing charges for robbery with a firearm and attempted murder. In Toronto, a woman was stabbed in broad daylight by a man who had been released on bail just days earlier. In Vancouver, organized crime rings are recruiting youth to commit car thefts and armed robberies, knowing they will be released within hours. In my community of Brampton, a home invasion resulted in the death of a young Canadian. In one of the most heartbreaking cases, Bailey McCourt was murdered by her ex-husband just hours after he was released on bail following an assault conviction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889994">We are witnessing an exponential rise in crime across the country, but nowhere is it more evident than in my hometown of Brampton. In the Peel region, police recently made the largest drug bust in its history. Shockingly, six of the nine accused were already out on bail. In another major operation, targeting an extortion ring, half of the people arrested were also on judicial release. Just weeks ago in Brampton, a violent home invasion ended with a father's being shot for doing nothing more than defending his home and family. This is the result of the Liberals' Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, which introduced the so-called principle of restraint, a policy that prioritizes release even when the accused has a violent history or is likely to reoffend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889995">Police officers, victims and legal experts have all said the same thing: The bail system is broken, and now is the time to fix it. The solution is jail, not bail, restoring safety and trust back on our streets, in our homes and in our lives. Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document>, the jail not bail act, is a common-sense Conservative solution that would put public safety first and restore trust in our justice system. Judges and police would have to prioritize protecting the public, not just the rights of the accused, when deciding on bail.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8889996">The bill would take away automatic bail for violent offenders. If someone is charged with a major violent offence, like attempted murder, sexual assault, kidnapping or armed robbery, they would not be released automatically. If they have already been convicted of a major offence in the last 10 years and are charged again while out on bail, the bill proposes that they must be detained.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889997">The bill would allow only judges to decide bail for repeat offenders. Police officers can now release someone charged with a major offence. Only a superior court judge would be able to make that decision. It would also remove criminals as sureties. People convicted of a serious crime in the last 10 years would not be able to act as a surety; there would be no more criminals vouching for criminals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889998"> The bill proposes stronger rules for non-citizens. Non-citizens and non-permanent residents would hand over their passport before being released, reducing flight risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889999">The bill would offer better risk assessment. The law would change the standard from “substantial likelihood” to “reasonably foreseeable”, making it easier to detain someone who poses a threat. Judges would also consider the accused's criminal history, including past failures to comply with bail. It would ask for an annual transparency report. The minister of justice would have to publish a yearly report on bail reforms, bail outcomes, repetition and disparities so Canadians would know what is working and what is not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890000">Conservatives are taking the lead. While the Liberals stall and spin, Conservatives are acting. We are calling on the House to immediately pass Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document>. We are ready to support extended sittings to get this done because Canadians deserve safe streets, a justice system they can depend on to protect them, and no more headlines about violent criminals walking free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890001">Before I end, I have a message for Brampton residents, which is that they should stay strong. We all know that injustice has risen in our community for far too long; that is why, as their member of Parliament, I, alongside the Conservative Party, will work tirelessly to make our streets safer. I will stop at nothing to ensure that the residents of Brampton will once again feel safe and protected in the community and in their own home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890002">The choice is clear. Canadians are tired of excuses. We can continue down the Liberal path of hug-a-thug justice, where innocent, law-abiding Canadians live in fear, or we can stand up for the victims, restore law and order and put violent criminals where they belong: behind bars. Let us pass the jail not bail act. Let us protect Canadians. Let us bring safety back to our streets.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8890018">Mr. Speaker, Canadians feel betrayed, stabbed in the back, both literally and metaphorically. Every day, the people of Richmond Hill South and families across Canada watch as violent offenders are being arrested in the morning and then let back out on our streets before nightfall, due to a decade of Liberal soft-on-crime laws. Seniors are afraid to walk to the grocery store. Parents are terrified to let their kids take the bus after dark. Who do we have to thank? The pro-crime Liberals, who have intentionally put the rights of repeat violent offenders ahead of the rights of law-abiding Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890019">The Conservative jail not bail act is about one thing: standing with Canadians, not felons; standing with victims, not criminals; and standing with Canadians, not the pro-crime Liberals and their revolving door of a justice system that created the crime crisis. That is why Canadians from all walks of life agree that it is time to scrap Liberal bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890020">Richmond Hill is under siege. Just weeks ago, gunfire ripped through a quiet Richmond Hill neighbourhood. A man was killed by an illegal gun, execution style, in the middle of a street in broad daylight. Parents dragged their children inside. Families huddled in fear. This is the question that echoed: Why is this happening in our once safe neighbourhood? Gangs are shooting up peaceful neighbourhoods and robbing homes, and this is often done by repeat offenders who are recommitting after being released, because of lax Liberal bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890021">At Highway 7 and Leslie, someone was carjacked at gunpoint, Grand Theft Auto style. People were robbed in broad daylight at Major Mackenzie and Bayview. Places of worship were attacked by acts of hate on 16th Avenue and Bathurst. In the Hillcrest mall, robberies by repeat offenders, which have caused lockdowns, have seniors and shoppers scared to go out anymore. People are losing family members because of intentional acts of arson by criminals who are lighting up innocent people in their own homes at night, right in Richmond Hill. These are not just statistics. This is real people, real fear and real victims. Every single one of these tragedies was enabled by the pro-crime Liberal laws that keep criminals on the streets instead of behind bars. That is why it is high time to scrap Liberal bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890022">The numbers do not lie and the human stories are heartbreaking, but the numbers confirm it. After 10 years of Liberal pro-crime laws, violent crime is up 55%, gun crime has more than doubled, extortion is up 330%, homicides are up 29%, sexual assaults are up 76%, and auto theft in the GTA is at levels never seen before. This did not happen by accident, but by design, because the pro-crime Liberals passed Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890023">Mandatory prison time was abolished for dozens of charges, and house arrest became the new norm. The Liberal catch-and-release came into effect, and the Liberal pro-crime revolving door in the justice system was set into motion. The Liberals handcuffed the police and set the criminals free. The result is that the people of Richmond Hill South, and Canadians across the country, live in fear while the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> shrugs and the minister of injustice makes jokes about the Wild West. That is not leadership; that is negligence. It is disgraceful. The only way to put an end to this and bring home safe streets again is by scrapping Liberal bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890024">Let us talk about the real cost of this Liberal failure. The cost is paid by Canadians, by blood, trauma and the loss of loved ones. In Richmond Hill, seniors tell me they will not walk through the mall or go to the park anymore. It is no longer safe. Parents living near Yonge Street say that their children cannot take public transit after dark. Teens cannot ride their bikes anymore because criminals are preying on their bikes and their lives. Shopkeepers on Highway 7 do not even bother reporting theft because the same thief is back the next day thanks to the pro-crime Liberals and their lax bail laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890025">What about the police officers who risk their lives arresting violent offenders only to see them walk free before their shift is even over. It has gotten so bad that the York Regional Police chief is asking victims of crime to simply comply with the demands of criminals who the Liberal injustice system has let out. That is not justice; it is betrayal. They have been straight-up stabbed in the back. That is the legacy of 10 years of the pro-crime Liberals. The only way to bring justice to the victims and families is by scrapping Liberal bail.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8890026">The Conservative jail not bail act would bring back sanity, common sense and peace of mind. It would lock up repeat violent offenders and slam the door on gang members. It would ensure that gun criminals, who are often using illegally obtained guns, stay behind bars where they belong. It would also force judges to finally put public safety first, not Liberal ideology.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890027">First, this legislation would repeal the Liberal principle of restraint and put public protection first instead of the criminal. This would ensure that communities are not left at the mercy of the pro-crime Liberals after all they have endured with a decade of the Liberals' soft-on-crime approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890028">Second, it would introduce a new major offences category, which would reverse the onus on bail conditions for crimes involving firearms, sexual assault, kidnapping, human trafficking, home invasion, robbery, extortion, arson and assault. It would require the accused to prove why they should be let out on bail. This would stop career criminals unleashed by the Liberal crime wave from taking advantage of this broken Liberal injustice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890029">Next, it would mandate judges to consider the full criminal history of the accused and prevent anyone convicted of a major offence while on bail in the last 10 years from receiving bail, thus ending the Liberals' revolving door injustice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890030">Lastly, this legislation would prohibit anyone with an indictable conviction from acting as a guarantor and would require non-residents to surrender their passports upon request.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890031">Conservatives stand with victims, families and Canadians. That is the choice before the House. Will parliamentarians from all parties, and Liberals alike, come together and vote to scrap Liberal bail?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890032">Let us call this what it is: a pro-crime Liberal record. Liberal pro-crime Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> scrapped jail time for violent crimes involving weapons and allowed for house arrest instead of mandatory prison time for serious offences and a dozen other charges. Liberal pro-crime Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> lowered the bar so that repeat offenders could walk free and tied the hands of provincial governments, judges and police.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890033">What did Canadians and the people of Richmond Hill get in return? They received more Liberal-sponsored gang shootings, more Liberal-sponsored carjackings, more Liberal-sponsored home invasions and more victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890034">The pro-crime Liberals talk about restorative justice. Tell that to the shopkeeper robbed for the third time because of lax Liberal bail laws. Tell that to the seniors imprisoned in their homes in fear of the crime wave unleashed by the Liberal government. Tell that to the mother who buried her son after a Liberal-sponsored gang shooting. Is the Liberal government going to restore her son's life? There is nothing restorative about that, only Liberal failure and injustice. To bring justice to victims and Canadians across this country, we must scrap Liberal bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890035">Premiers, provincial attorneys general and police chiefs across the country, including from the York Regional Police in Richmond Hill, have begged Parliament to fix the Liberals' soft-on-crime bail before more blood is spilled by the Liberal-sponsored crime wave, but the pro-crime Liberals refused. They ignored the warnings and calls to action from victims, police and communities alike. They left officers demoralized and communities exposed to the crime wave the Liberals unleashed. It went so far that the Liberal minister of injustice mocked victims by referring to this Liberal-sponsored crime wave as not being the Wild West. It is Canada, but it sure feels like it.</ParaText>

The truth is that faith is the very foundation of our civilization, bracing humanity against the unrelenting storms of life by providing us hope of something greater and better than ourselves. It acts as a north star leading us home and empowers great men, such as Lord Wilberforce in his unrelenting fight against slavery, to call out injustice and speak truth in a dark and divided world.</ParaText>

Seven thousand Christians were massacred this year alone and the faithful must now meet in secret or in burned-out sanctuaries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890075">Sadly, the world is turning a blind eye to the plight of Christians in Nigeria. There are no embedded journalists covering the violence. There are no daily updates. Politicians around the world are not asked questions about how they will respond. We cannot ignore this violence and tragic loss of life. We must speak out and shine a light on what is happening so that people can donate to relief efforts and provide support to those displaced by the violence.</ParaText>

She founded the Jane Goodall Institute, which continues her global mission to protect wildlife and inspire hope. Her groundbreaking discoveries about chimpanzees transformed humanity's understanding of our closest relatives and reminded us of a truth long held by indigenous peoples: that we are not separate from nature but deeply connected to it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890079">Her life's work sparked a revolution of empathy for animals, for the environment and for each other. In this time of climate crisis and biodiversity loss, her message has never been more urgent. Dr. Goodall gave hope to generations, especially young people, who carry forward a vision of a planet where all creatures are treated with compassion.</ParaText>

Property crime rates and violent crime rates are now higher in Canada than they are in the United States. That is because of 10 years of weak Liberal bail laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890316">If the Liberals could just admit that they failed, after 10 years of their soft-on-crime approach, they could support the Conservative jail not bail act and scrap Liberal bail.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8890321">Mr. Speaker, I will not provide any further comment on the member's lack of a response to my question, but I think it is a legitimate issue when we take a look at the stats the Conservatives continue to provide the House. I would suggest to anyone who is listening to do a bit of a follow-through on the stats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890322">I will start off by reflecting on the last federal election. Every member of the House, I am sure, is aware of what was taking place on the streets, homes and communities we all represent. I can say with absolute confidence, as I have said earlier today, and even last week when the Conservatives brought in another motion dealing with the issue of crime, that it is an issue the government is acting on. The Conservative opposition knows that. Canadians know that, because we made a commitment in the election platform to have significant bail reform for this fall. The <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has made and reinforced that commitment, and we will see bail reform coming to the floor of the House of Commons. Why? It is because it is not only a reflection of what Canadians were talking about in the last election but also a commitment that every Liberal member of Parliament made to their constituents. We are going to see bail reform legislation. That is the motivation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890323">I say to my Conservative friends across the way that, not only were we given a solid mandate in the last election to bring forward our platform, but also the opposition was given a message. We all have a responsibility to our constituents to advance legislation and ideas for the betterment of our communities. That is why, earlier today, I had the opportunity to ask a number of questions. One of those questions was dealing with Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890324">Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> is one of the measures to secure and make Canadians safer by doing more at our borders. We have now had over 18 hours of debate on that legislation. There is no indication whatsoever from the Conservatives as to when they are going to allow that bill to pass the House of Commons, let alone get it out of second reading so that it can go to committee, where Canadians and stakeholders will have the opportunity to provide direct input. We even had a minister indicate that he is open to ideas and suggestions that might give additional strength to the legislation. I say all of that because I want the people who are following the debate on the issue of crime and safety in our neighbourhoods to understand what is motivating this, whether it is the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the cabinet or the entire Liberal caucus. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890325">I will contrast that to what I have witnessed from the Conservative Party. What is motivating the Conservative Party as Conservatives continue to ratchet up hard feelings and division? I believe that it is very real and very tangible. I have some quotes that I would like to share. There are three in particular. Here is something that the member for <Affiliation DbId="317990" Type="2">Cariboo—Prince George</Affiliation> said in September, “in my riding, 98% of the crime is created by five or six prolific offenders. When they are in jail, the crime rate goes down.” I would question the numbers, but I question the numbers on a lot of things with the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890326"> However, here is something that I find truly amazing. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8890327">This is what a Conservative member said on the floor of the House. The MP for <Affiliation DbId="317835" Type="2">Oxford</Affiliation> said, “We are now living in a war zone in Canada.” He was referencing the issue of crime and safety. How ridiculous a statement that is. We can think about that, having a member of Parliament standing up and saying we are in a war zone. I think the member needs to get a better understanding of what a war zone actually is. However, I cannot blame him because it comes right from the leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890328">Leadership within the Conservative party has gone so far to the right. Members can listen to the things he says, the extreme comments we get from the <Affiliation DbId="322132" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>. Today, when I was asking him a question, in part this is what his response was: “The extreme bloodshed and violence that Liberals have unleashed is what is radical.” I expect the member might want to clip that and put it out on his social media because it truly reflects the type of leadership we are seeing from the Conservative Party. Nothing has changed with the leader.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890329">I remember a quote that I said last year, that the <Affiliation DbId="322132" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> said to his caucus. The entire Conservative caucus got together, and what did the leader of the Conservative Party have to say? The headline was “...'nuclear winter,' [leader of the Conservative Party] tells his MPs”. I quote from the article:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8890332">This is the type of leadership we see coming out of the Conservative leadership office: extreme positions. Then we wonder why we get members making the statement that we are in a war zone when it comes to crime. It is ridiculous. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890333">What motivates the Conservatives on crime? I will contrast what motivates the government, which is, as I pointed out, an electoral mandate and listening to our constituents. The legislation that is ultimately brought forward on bail reform will be a true reflection of their expectations and needs and what Canadians want to see. It is something that is being well taken care of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890334">The Conservatives say he has been <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for five months and ask where the legislation is. If we are going to have significant bail reform legislation, there is a responsibility to do some consultation. There is a responsibility as a government, and as a minister, to work with the many different stakeholders, whether the police, non-profits, territories or provincial governments, and the list goes on. It is not something where they lock themselves in a room and then come up with a substantial piece of legislation and put it on the table of the House of Commons. There is actually a lot of work involved in bringing forward the type of bail reform we are going to be seeing this fall. That gives us a sense of what motivates the Liberal caucus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890335">I have argued and I have seen over the years that the Conservatives love to talk tough about crime. They really do. It is as if there were no horrific crimes when Harper was the Prime Minister of Canada. That is sarcasm. There were a lot of horrific crimes. I can assure members there were. At the end of the day, whether home invasions, murders or whatever type of crime, I can assure members that it took place even under Stephen Harper, even when their <Affiliation DbId="322132" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> sat around the cabinet table.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8890341">Mr. Speaker, I withdraw the word “hate”, but let us realize that fundraising plays a critical role in why the Conservative Party takes the position it takes. It is all about raising money. Let me give a good example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890342">Here are four emails. These are all emails that the Conservative Party has sent out to literally thousands and thousands of people. Every one of these emails actually has a link to donate to the Conservative Party. One says, “More criminals loose on the streets to terrorize our people.” Another one says, “Criminals are WREAKING HAVOC across our country.” The third one says, “The cause of this VIOLENT uptick in crime? The Liberals' radical catch-and-release policies.” The fourth email says, “Crime is out of control — and it's only going to get worse”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890343"> These Conservative fundraising emails are circulating for one purpose, to raise money. Is it any wonder I make the statement that the Conservative Party uses the issue of crime and safety as a mechanism to fill its political coffers? That is the reality.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890344">At the end of the day, if we want to look at how to serve Canadians on the crime file, it is first and foremost to reflect, as we have as a new government, as the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has in the commitment to bail reform, on what it is Canadians are telling us. We are prepared to accept judgment when the time is right, when we have the bail reform legislation before us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890345">However, let me warn my Conservative friends across the way that there is other legislation before the House that would make our communities safer, that would provide more support for our law enforcement officers and our border control officers. The Conservatives have yet to pass that legislation. I am referring to Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>. Bill C-2 is substantial legislation. With the very limited amount of time that the House has for debate, the Conservatives continue to talk that legislation out. Bill C-2 would make a difference. It would make our communities safer. If the Conservatives really and truly are genuine in wanting to make our streets safer, why are they holding up the bill at second reading?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890346">In fact, the motion we are talking about today is about how we could speed up a private member's bill. It is not the first time. The <Affiliation DbId="317911" Type="2">member</Affiliation> who stood up on the point of order spoke about his private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="13584104" Type="4">C-225</Document>, an act to amend the Criminal Code. He said, “This bill is a monumental change.” He continued, “I ask that the House streamline the passing of this bill as quickly as possible.” That is a programmed bill. It gets two hours of debate at second reading. Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> has already had 18 hours of debate. After two hours, his bill gets to go to committee, yet he is asking us to speed it up even more, just as we saw here today on another private member's bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890347">The work involved in getting legislation before the House needs to be respected. Oh, how the Conservatives cry if the government applies a bit of pressure or attempts to shame them into doing the right thing, to be there for Canadians by passing legislation. When it comes to their legislation, democracy goes out the door. That is what I witness. If members challenge what I am saying, I invite them to have me go to a public meeting at a university.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8890348">Let us see if we can bring in some independent individuals who would take a look at the arguments the Conservatives have. I would take no issue at all. Ideally it would be in Winnipeg North, but I can be flexible; it could be in Ottawa. Including with the member opposite, I would welcome the opportunity to have a good, healthy debate in Ottawa, although we cannot be sitting in session, in terms of the hours. Outside of the hours, I am sure we can arrange something. The bottom line is that the Conservatives apply a double standard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890349">Here is the reason I raise this: We know that Canadians are genuinely concerned about crime and safety in their communities. We know that for a fact. We understand that there needs to be bail reform. There needs to be tougher penalties for repeat violent offenders. Canadians elected the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal government on a platform of reforming the bail system. We are, in fact, committed to working together to ensure that we can make stronger laws and have safer communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890350">In these five to six months, we have put into place legislative measures and budgetary measures from a commitment to increase RCMP officers by hundreds and do the same thing in terms of border control. There has been extensive consultation, and I think there is a responsibility for all members of Parliament, no matter what side of the House they are on, to recognize the agenda before us and to come down and talk about how we can achieve what all of us say we want to see: safer communities and individuals who are committing these crimes, especially repeat offenders, being held to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890351">These are all important things, but it is also important for us to recognize that the federal government plays a significant role that we are living up to. When I think of our judicial system, it is not just Ottawa. There are provincial governments and, arguably, municipal governments that also have a significant role to play. We know that. The last time I was speaking on a very similar issue, I referred to the need for more Crown prosecutors. I cited a story in the Winnipeg Free Press from September 9, an editorial. It amplified and tried to say that the province was at fault because of the issue of Crown attorneys.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890352"> Members can go ahead and look up the story to read it for themselves. I will read one line from it. The bottom line is this:</ParaText>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890354">This is something that reflects on provincial governments. Municipal governments provide law enforcement officers. To not recognize that law enforcement officers play a role or that provinces play a role is irresponsible. At the end of the day, it is a shared responsibility. Ottawa needs to do its job, and the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the new government that were elected just last April are doing the job that Canadians want us to do on this critically important issue.

              <ParaText id="8890383">I rise today not to debate ideology but to defend a principle that every Canadian holds dear: the right to feel safe in their own community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890384">From Richmond to Vancouver and from Kelowna to Surrey, Canadians are witnessing a justice system that no longer protects them. Violent offenders are arrested, brought before a judge and, despite long criminal histories and active bail conditions, are released again, sometimes within hours and sometimes with fatal consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890385">Let me tell members about Tori Dunn, a 30-year-old woman from Surrey who was murdered in her own home by a man who had been released on bail despite facing robbery charges and having a long history of violence. Her death was not inevitable; it was preventable. There is also Jordan Paul Campbell Mutual, who had 10 outstanding warrants while out on bail. He set two police officers on fire during an arrest attempt. Mohammed Majidpour, who had over 24 prior convictions, assaulted a woman with a metal pole and committed arson on the same day. He had been released on bail multiple times. These are not isolated incidents; they are the result of a justice system that prioritizes procedure over protection and leaves communities to bear the consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890386">The numbers do not lie. Between November 2022 and December 2023, British Columbia held nearly 4,800 bail hearings. In them, crime prosecutors sought detention in only 23% of cases, and judges granted detention just 41% of the time. In violent crime cases, judges ordered detention in only 43% of them, even when the accused was already out on bail for yet another violent offence. In Kelowna, 15 repeat offenders were responsible for over 1,300 police files in one single year. That is one police interaction every four days per person.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890387">This is not a justice system that protects the public; it is one that enables repeat offenders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890388">At the heart of the crisis is Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>. Passed in 2019, it introduced the principle of restraint, requiring judges to release accused offenders at the earliest opportunity and under the least restrictive conditions. While intended to ensure fairness, it has had the opposite effect on public safety. Judges now feel bound to release individuals who pose a clear risk. Repeat violent offenders exploit the system. Crown prosecutors, constrained by federal policy, seek detention in fewer than one in four cases. Even when they do, judges often decline. This disconnect between the Crown and the judiciary is not just procedural but dangerous. It creates a system where public safety is treated as secondary, and where legal technicalities override lived realities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890389">Meanwhile, our peace officers are sounding alarms, and it is time to listen. Police officers are arresting the same individuals repeatedly, only to see them walk free. They face burnout, frustration and rising violence. In Vancouver alone last year there were 6,200 violent crimes, including nearly 5,000 assaults. Assaults on public officers rose by 20% in a single year. Vancouver police chief, Adam Palmer, has called for urgent bail reform. Deputy Chief Howard Chow said that reverse-onus bail provisions would, in his words, “dramatically improve” public safety. Even Vancouver mayor, Ken Sim, speaking bluntly, said, “Excuse my language, but that's [BS]”, when he was talking about a man with 60 police interactions who was released yet again, only to commit another violent attack.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8890390">This is not just a policing issue; it is also a public safety crisis. While the system fails to contain repeat offenders, victims are being retraumatized. Imagine surviving a violent crime, reporting it and then seeing one's attacker walking free, days after, back in one's neighbourhood, back into one's life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890391">There is no justice in retraumatization. Victims often face sleepless nights, anxiety and fear, not just from the crime itself but also from the knowledge that the system may not protect them. Families like that of Tori Dunn feel betrayed. Survivors of assault and harassment are forced to relive their trauma every time they see their attacker walk free. This is not just emotional; it is systemic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890392">When victims see attackers released without consequence, it sends a dangerous message that their pain is secondary, that their safety is negotiable and that justice for them is optional. Across Canada, people are asking why violent offenders are walking free. Why are police arresting the same person over and over again? Why does the system seem more concerned with the rights of repeat offenders than with the safety of law-abiding citizens? The answers are buried in legislation that prioritizes leniency over logic and in a judicial culture that has lost sight of its duty to protect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890393">A recent survey shows that 68% of Canadians now believe that the bail system is too lenient, a dramatic increase from just 41% three years ago. This is not just a perception problem; it is a reflection of lived experience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890394">I know what the Liberals and their NDP allies will say. They will argue that tougher bail is too harsh. They will say that criminals deserve a second chance, but how many second chances should a repeat violent offender get before an innocent person loses their life? How many times should a small business owner be robbed before we admit that the system is failing?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890395">The truth is that our opponents are more concerned with ideology than with safety. They lecture Canadians about root causes, while ignoring the root fact, which is that when a violent offender is behind bars, they cannot harm innocent people. That is why we are supporting the jail not bail motion. It is not radical; it is reasonable. It would not target first-time offenders. It would not strip anyone of their rights. It does say that if someone has been convicted of three or more serious offences, they should not be eligible for bail, probation or parole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890396">It says that if someone is charged with a major offence, like sexual assault, home invasion or a firearms offence, they should face reverse-onus bail. Judges must consider someone's full criminal history, not just the current charge. If someone has recently been convicted of a major offence, they should not be released again while facing new charges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890397">It is not about punishment; it is about prevention, about protection and about restoring trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890398">Let us stand with victims, restore safe streets and act now, because justice delayed is danger delivered, and Canadians cannot wait for more.</ParaText>

They would not worry if they had forgotten to lock their doors, and they would go to bed knowing they were safe in their own beds. However, over the last decade, that sense of security has been shattered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890415">My friends in my community no longer feel safe walking at night. When our youth go to school, they face threats of gun violence, stabbings and assaults. Our seniors are anxious, wondering if their cars will be on the driveway when they wake up in the morning. Just last Wednesday, two homes fell prey to shootings. The shootings happened only minutes apart, and both of these homes had been shot earlier the same month. That means the residents have now lived twice through violent attacks. Recently in Vaughan, three suspects were arrested for committing a series of home invasions, and two of these suspects were already out on bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890416">What happened? The Liberals introduced bail reform with Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, and these Liberal bail laws have completely broken our bail system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890417">What needs to change? Today, this is exactly what we are here to address. This is far from a partisan issue. Premiers, mayors, police associations, attorneys general and Canadians have been asking for the federal government to end catch-and-release bail laws like Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, a law that forces judges to apply the principle of restraint, which puts repeat violent offenders back on the streets, and Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document>, which repealed mandatory jail time for serious gun crimes, including extortion with a firearm. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890418">We all know the consequences. Since these laws were introduced, all across Canada, violent crime is up by 55%, firearm crime is up by 130%, extortion has skyrocketed by 330%, sexual assaults are up by 76% and homicides are up by 29%. In 2019, David Lametti, now the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s right-hand man, passed Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, forcing judges to release offenders at the earliest opportunity under the least onerous conditions.</ParaText>

Third, it would strengthen bail laws by mandating judges to consider an accused's full criminal history and would prevent anyone from getting bail who was convicted of a major offence in the last 10 years and is charged with a major offence while out on bail. Fourth, it would prohibit anybody with an indictable conviction from acting as a guarantor, would require judges to enforce bail conditions on guarantors and would require non-residents to surrender their passport upon request.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8890452">I am very pleased to have this opportunity to explain what the government is currently doing to build safe communities and to prevent crime, as well as our plans for the future. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890453">Canadians expect the government to be smart about fighting crime. I want to thank and commend the many mayors, provincial partners, and provincial and municipal police forces for their ongoing collaborative efforts to reduce gun and gang crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890454">We are all responsible for making things better, and we all want to make things better. That is why, in recent years, the Canadian government has made significant improvements to Canada's firearms laws. New firearms licensing requirements have come into force, maximum penalties for firearms trafficking and smuggling have been increased, and many new harm reduction tools have been put in place. We will keep working to ensure that Canada's firearms regime is responsible and effective, supports the safe use of firearms by law-abiding owners and protects our Canadian communities from the devastating effects of gun violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890455">Effective enforcement and operational co-operation are also essential in the fight against gun violence. Investments have also been made to improve law enforcement and border security services. This includes funding for the RCMP to increase its capacity to trace crime guns and enhance anti-smuggling activities, as well as funding to the CBSA to strengthen border controls in order to prevent the smuggling of firearms into the country. We will also continue to strengthen co-operation with key U.S. partners, including through the cross-border firearms task force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890456">We know that gun violence is a tragic reality across the country and that it is often linked to street gangs. For too long, the roots of this violence have been neglected. The Canadian government has made considerable efforts to change this situation, because everyone deserves to feel safe in their communities, and that sense of safety is shattered every time a violent crime occurs. Our efforts must start there, in the community. Grassroots efforts, meaning community-led initiatives, can help address the social conditions that lead to criminal behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890457">Getting tough on crime is not enough; we also have to be smart and strategic about our approach. We need to get to the root cause of the problem. In the community, this is done by addressing the social determinants of crime. These are conditions that may lead individuals to engage in violent and criminal behaviour. Our government firmly believes that any solution to gun and gang violence must combine prevention and intervention efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890458">In 2022, for example, the Department of Public Safety launched the building safer communities fund, which provided $250 million directly to municipalities and indigenous communities to strengthen gang prevention programs and address the social conditions that give rise to crime. This money supports initiatives that tackle the root causes of gun crime by supporting community-led projects that address violence among youth involved in or at risk of joining gangs. The fund uses data, including demographic data and crime statistics, to direct investments where they will have the greatest impact. This targeted approach ensures that the most at-risk communities receive timely support that they can invest in protecting the safety of their residents.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8890459">To support communities, $391 million will go directly to the provinces and territories as part of the gun and gang violence action fund, and $10 million will be allocated to the youth gang prevention fund.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890460">That is in addition to more than $40 million per year for the national crime prevention strategy, which supports community efforts to prevent youth involvement in crime and tackle known risk factors.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890461">In June 2022, the Government of Canada also tabled the federal framework to reduce recidivism, which aims to break the cycle of reoffending, support rehabilitation and make our communities safer for everyone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890462">Over the past few years, the Government of Canada has also introduced reforms to simplify unnecessarily complex or redundant bail rules that caused unfortunate and detrimental delays in the criminal justice system without necessarily improving public safety. Canadian bail laws are very clear. A person must be detained while awaiting trial if their release would pose a public safety risk or undermine confidence in the administration of justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890463">That said, we are determined to continue working with the provinces and territories to make responsible and effective changes to the bail system, where warranted. Similarly, our partners know as well as we do that when it comes to preventing and combatting gun and gang violence, there is still much work to be done together. We are hopeful that both sides of the House can work together.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8890469"> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my hon. colleague's speech to the House, but I cannot help but be frustrated, and my constituents are frustrated, by the release of criminals back into society. He stated that people who are arrested must be detained if there is a risk of reoffending, yet we see evidence time and time again that they are let go. I visited detachments and police in my riding. They are afraid, and they fear for their own safety when repeatedly arresting the same criminals again and again.</ParaText>

That is why, as the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said again today, we will very shortly be bringing the House a proposal to reform the bail system that will achieve three known objectives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890472">The first objective is to combat gun violence and organized crime to make it harder for violent repeat offenders to get bail. The second objective is to increase the penalties for violent repeat offenders, particularly those involved in organized crime, break-ins, auto theft and human trafficking. The third objective is to reduce court delays, as our colleague from <Affiliation DbId="318092" Type="2">Montcalm</Affiliation> was saying. Reducing these delays warrants careful consideration of this bail reform proposal.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8890479">Mr. Speaker, I am deeply honoured to rise today and speak on such an important topic that affects Canadians, their peace of mind and their safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890480">My speech will address the issue from a number of angles. Specifically, I would like to discuss the need to work in a much more systematic way with multiple stakeholders. I would also like to talk about the need to address the issue in a much more thoughtful way, as my colleague so aptly said, and from a legal perspective that takes our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890481">Canadians expect to live in safe, peaceful communities. They want a government that is tough on crime but capable of making smart choices. That is exactly the path we are on. I want to start by thanking our partners, who are very important stakeholders in this decision. They include the mayors, provinces, police departments and community organizations doing critical work on the ground. Thanks to them, our fight against guns and gangs is making headway. They deserve recognition in the House and elsewhere for their daily commitment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890482">Unfortunately, gun violence remains a tragic reality in too many neighbourhoods. Every shooting and every life lost is a stark reminder that we must continue to work tirelessly. That is exactly what we are doing with stronger laws and strict enforcement. In recent years, we have modernized our laws to strengthen gun control. We have established stricter licensing rules, introduced tougher penalties for gun trafficking and smuggling, and put in place new tools to help law enforcement trace crime guns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890483">We have also invested in the RCMP and the CBSA to enhance their ability to intercept illegal weapons. We are working hand in hand with our American partners, because cross-border smuggling requires a coordinated response. Protecting Canadians requires strong laws as well as effective police co-operation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890484">I would like to focus on a word that carries a lot of weight, one that is extremely important, but that I do not often hear from the other side of the House. That word is prevention. Prevention means addressing the root cause. However, in order to address the root cause, we must first understand the social determinants that lead a person to commit a criminal act or a violent act that could be criminal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890485">However, we also know that just filling up prisons will not solve these problems. To build truly safe communities, we need to work on prevention. That is why we launched the building safer communities fund to provide $250 million directly to municipalities and indigenous communities. This funding supports grassroots prevention programs to provide tangible alternatives for at-risk youth so they do not end up in a life of crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890486">This is in addition to $400 million for the gun and gang violence action fund, as well as ongoing investments through the national crime prevention strategy. These measures support on-the-ground initiatives, such as mentoring, sports, training and academic support. Every dollar invested in prevention is a dollar invested in the safety and future of our young people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890487">We also need to talk about how we have to break the cycle of recidivism. We may agree on that goal, but we disagree with how the members opposite want to go about achieving it. Public safety is not just about preventing people from embarking on a life of crime; it is also about preventing recidivism.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8890488">In 2022, we adopted a federal framework to reduce recidivism, a first in Canada. This framework identifies risk factors, supports rehabilitation and promotes the safe reintegration of offenders into society. Ultimately, breaking the cycle of recidivism also means breaking the cycle of violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890489">Now let us talk about bail. Our government wants to reform the bail system to make it clearer and more effective. The rule is simple: When someone poses a threat to public safety, they must remain behind bars. When release is justified, it must be supervised so as to never compromise public confidence in the justice system. It is in this spirit that we are working closely with the provinces and territories to improve the system, always with the aim of striking a balance between public safety and respect for the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890490">In conclusion, there is no quick fix. Instead, we are implementing smart ideas to put an end to gun violence and street gangs. One thing is clear: By combining strong laws with better equipped police services and significant investments in prevention and rehabilitation, we can save lives and give Canadians back the basic right to feel safe in their communities. This is our government's commitment and the vision we are standing up for: a Canada that is safer, fairer and more united.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8890508">Mr. Speaker, it is always an honour to rise on behalf of my riding of Kitchener Centre. I rise not just as a member of Parliament today but as a representative of a community. My community, Kitchener, is hurting. It is hurting from rising crime, broken trust and a justice system that no longer puts public safety first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890509">After a summer of violent crime and eroded trust in our public safety, Canadians are demanding swift action and they have every right to do so. Across this country, violent crime is up 55%. Firearms offences from non-law-abiding citizens have surged by 130%, and extortion has skyrocketed by 330%. These are not just statistics. They represent shattered lives, grieving families and communities living in fear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890510">This crisis did not happen by accident. In 2019, the Liberal government passed Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, which forced judges to release offenders at the earliest possible opportunity under the least restrictive conditions. As a result, there is a revolving door by which repeat violent offenders end up back on our streets. I want to be clear: This is a crisis of the Liberals' own making, and Canadians are left to live with the devastating consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890511">I will be splitting my time today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890512">We have all heard the heartbreaking stories. One that stays with me is that of Daniel Senecal. He was convicted of sexual assault, released under weakened bail laws and then accused of sexually assaulting a three-year-old child, whom we have come to know as little E. This three-year-old child has had to spend three weeks in the hospital recovering from this unimaginable, irrevocable act, and she will be scarred for life. She is a child. That is the cost of this system, which prioritizes offenders over victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890513">There is also Scott Weller, a victim of a violent home invasion. Scott said, “As someone who knows firsthand the trauma of a violent home invasion, I believe strongly in the need for Jail not Bail. My family was attacked in what should have been the safety of our own home. The idea that violent offenders could be released back onto our streets is terrifying—not just for us, but for every Canadian family.” Scott's words are powerful. They remind us that public safety must come first, that the rights of victims and families must come before the rights of violent offenders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890514"> The Toronto Police Association put it plainly: “The proposed ideas will put victims and communities first, restoring the balance that is desperately needed at a time when youth violence and gun crimes are out of control and innocent victims are paying the ultimate price.” This is why Conservatives are introducing Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document>, the jail not bail act. The bill would restore accountability, protect communities and put victims first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890515">I will bring this closer to my riding in Kitchener. In the region of Waterloo, in 2024 alone, there were 3,896 undertakings and 2,334 releases. That is a 61% release rate. This means that the majority of the accused individuals were sent back into our neighbourhoods. What is even more troubling is that approximately 50% of the charges brought forward by the Waterloo Regional Police are not being pursued by Crown prosecution. That is half of these cases gone. They are not prosecuted; they are gone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890516">Of those released on an undertaking or release order in 2023 and 2024, 20% were found to be in disregard of the terms of their release. What is worse is that more than half of those offenders were caught multiple times. These are the repeat offenders we need off our streets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890517">I received an email today from Anke, a 76-year-old woman in my community. She told me that she is nervous to walk around her community in broad daylight. She wants us to restore Canada to what it was, making it safe for her children and grandchildren.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890518">Families are not the only ones suffering. Businesses in the downtown core of Kitchener Centre are struggling. They are being broken into. Their customers are afraid to come downtown. The rise in crime is hurting our business community of hard-working entrepreneurs, who are trying to keep their doors open and staff safe.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8890519">Public safety is economic safety, and right now both are at risk, but perhaps the most disturbing example is what happened recently in my own community: the sexual assault and attempted kidnapping of a six-year-old child. The accused was released on conditions and is still residing in the same community where that child lives. This is not okay. Our children's safety is at risk. No parent should have to live with the fear that a violent offender is living down the street. No child should be put in harm's way because our justice system has failed to act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890520"> Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document>, the jail not bail act, would, first, repeal the Liberal principle of restraint and replace it with a directive that public protection and safety be the primary consideration. Second, it would create a new major offences category with reverse-onus bail conditions for charges like firearm offences, sexual assault, kidnapping, human trafficking, home invasion, robbery, extortion, arson and assault.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890521">Third, it would strengthen bail laws by requiring judges to consider an accused's full criminal history and by preventing bail for anyone convicted of a major offence in the last 10 years who is now charged again.

              <ParaText id="8890542">The motion suggests that the Liberal government proposed criminal justice reform in the last six months and has failed to act. However, the reality tells a very different story. Just last month, we introduced Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9,</Document> the combatting hate act, which includes targeted amendments to the Criminal Code to address hate-motivated offences. The legislation successfully passed second reading yesterday and is now moving to committee for detailed study and consideration. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8890543">The <Affiliation DbId="318625" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> worked tirelessly over the summer to find ways to strengthen and modernize our criminal justice system. He held consultations with his provincial and territorial counterparts as well as police forces, chiefs of police and their associations to ensure that any reform introduced is practical, evidence-based and truly tailored to the needs of Canadians. That is how responsible reform happens: through meticulous study, collaboration and expert advice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890544">Meanwhile, the Conservative <Affiliation DbId="322132" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> was far more preoccupied with his political future than any real public policy work. He spent his summer chasing after a second chance as a candidate parachuted into an Alberta by-election following his resounding defeat at the polls by voters from across the country in the last election, including voters from his former riding of Carleton. Still, he shows no signs of having learned from that experience. Instead of focusing on measures capable of truly improving public safety, he keeps proposing reckless initiatives based on political calculation, putting optics before real solutions to protect Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8890545">Canadians deserve more than slogans and political theatre. They deserve a government that listens, engages experts and acts decisively to make communities safer. That is exactly what the government is doing through legislation that addresses urgent issues while respecting the principles of justice and fairness. That is why the federal government has taken important steps to reform the bail system in recent years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890546">In 2023, former Bill <Document DbId="12426046" Type="3">C-48</Document> made meaningful changes to strengthen the bail system in response to concerns about efficiency and repeat offending. For example, it created a reverse onus to target serious repeat violent offences involving weapons. It expanded the list of firearms that trigger a reverse onus at bail. It also broadened the reverse onus, targeting repeat offenders in cases of intimate partner violence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890547">These changes made it more difficult for accused persons to obtain bail when they are charged with serious repeat violent offending. These changes were not the result of partisan initiatives. They reflected a broad collaboration with provinces, territories, law enforcement and legal experts. Every step was guided by data, evidence and consultation with those working on the front lines of criminal justice. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890548">Despite these reforms, we understand that Canadians remain concerned about repeat and violent offending. That is why, as set out in the government's 2025 electoral platform and reaffirmed at the first ministers' meeting in June, the government will introduce legislation this fall to further strengthen both bail and sentencing provisions in the Criminal Code.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8890550">Our government also committed to amending the Criminal Code to direct courts to primarily consider denunciation and deterrence when sentencing repeat car thieves or home invasion offenders.

              <ParaText id="8890552">We also know that reform cannot happen in isolation. The operation of the bail system is a shared responsibility between federal and provincial and territorial governments. While the federal government sets the legal framework, the provinces and territories manage day-to-day operations, including court and jail administration. Strengthening the law at the federal level must therefore be complemented by effective enforcement, resources and oversight at the provincial level. Without this coordination, even the best legislation would not achieve meaningful change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890553">Data and evidence also play a crucial role. Provinces and territories collect the data necessary to evaluate how bail laws are functioning, identify gaps and implement improvements. Better data allows government to track outcomes, assess risks and ensure that measures designed to protect public safety are actually working. This is why our government continues to work closely with partners across the nation to improve data collection, transparency and reporting in the criminal justice system.</ParaText>

It is built when governments work together to address the root causes of crime, including poverty, trauma, mental health issues and housing insecurity, and when individuals get the support they need to rebuild their lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890555">Canadians deserve a bail system that protects communities while respecting the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as well as a sentencing regime that holds offenders accountable while promoting reintegration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890556">Our government is delivering on that promise. We are not acting hastily or out of political expediency. We are consulting experts, collaborating with our provincial counterparts and developing laws that work in practice.

              <ParaText id="8890557">In conclusion, Canadians expect a government that acts responsibly, listens to experts and delivers results.

              <ParaText id="8890573">Every Canadian deserves to be safe in their community and in their own neighbourhood. Whether it is walking home from work at night, taking their children to school, playing at the park or simply opening the doors of a small business, people should not have to worry about violence or repeat offenders undermining their security and safety. The truth is that Canadians are worried. Violent crime is a real issue. Repeat violent offenders are a serious problem. Our government acknowledges this, and we are taking action to address it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890574">However, the motion before us today suggests that the Conservative proposal is some sort of magical solution to these issues, a single piece of legislation the Conservatives have branded the jail not bail act, another three-word clickbait slogan. They claim that passing this one bill will make Canadians safe. I have heard today and in the past a really unfortunate trend of Conservatives repeatedly politicizing awful, violent crimes to promote their political agenda and raise money. It is disgraceful. Canadians know better and Canadians deserve better. They deserve safety, and that requires more than just slogans. They know it requires real reform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890575">Let me remind the House of what has already been done. In 2023, our government passed bail reforms that made it harder for violent repeat offenders to be released. These reforms were targeted toward individuals charged with serious violent crimes and firearm crimes. They were supported by premiers. They were supported by police, and they are already in force across Canada today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890576">We also know this work is not finished. This is why, during the most recent election, our new Liberal government campaigned on and received a strong mandate for further reforms. In our platform, we committed to strengthening bail further. We committed to ensuring that prosecutors have the resources they need to oppose bail where appropriate, and we committed to ensuring that judges have the tools they need to keep Canadians safe while respecting fundamental charter rights. We are delivering on those promises. In this very session, in a few weeks, new measures will be brought forward to strengthen bail laws and tighten federal sentencing guidelines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890577">Let us look at the broader picture. The Conservatives claim that bail reform alone will solve violent crime, but the reality is that keeping Canadians safe requires work on three fronts: prevention, prosecution and protection. Our government has been clear that on prosecution, we are investing in federal Crown attorneys. Too often, federal Crowns are overloaded, their cases are delayed and dangerous offenders can slip through the cracks. Our government is committed to new funding for federal Crowns so they can prepare stronger cases, challenge inappropriate bail applications and move trials forward without unnecessary delays.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890578">On protection, we are expanding victim services, because Canadians who are harmed by violent crimes need support. Our government is increasing funding so that victims can access counselling, legal assistance and safety planning. This is part of our commitment to a justice system that protects people and also brings criminals to justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890579">On prevention, our government has made historic commitments. We are expanding youth programs so that young people have positive opportunities and do not end up in the justice system in the first place. We are investing in mental health and addictions treatment, because untreated illness and addiction are drivers of repeat offences. We are also supporting indigenous justice initiatives, because reconciliation and fairness are also part of public safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890580">None one of these measures are mentioned in the Conservative motion. None of these measures fit neatly into a silly three-word bumper sticker, but Canadians know they are essential to safe communities. The Conservatives like to talk about the need for urgency. They say, “Pass this bill today and rush it through.” Let us be clear: Urgency is not the same as effectiveness. Canadians do not want legislation that is rushed, half-considered and ultimately ineffective. They want reforms that work, that last and that withstand the scrutiny of courts and the test of time.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8890581">That is what our government is delivering. Our approach is comprehensive. We are reforming bail laws further this session, we are funding federal Crowns and judges to ensure that cases move more effectively, we are investing in victim services and community safety programs, and we are addressing the root causes of crime through youth initiatives, addiction treatment and mental health supports. That is the difference between this government and the opposition. It wants a headline and to divide Canadians for clicks, but we are delivering a real plan. The opposition wants to pretend that there is a silver bullet, but we know that Canadians deserve more than silly three-word slogans.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890582">I want to pause and remind our colleagues of the history. For 10 years, even under a Stephen Harper majority, the Conservatives had the chance to fix this. For 10 years, they could have strengthened bail. For 10 years, they could have funded prosecutors. For 10 years, they could have invested in prevention. They did not. Canadians remember the failures of the Harper years. Now they show up with silly slogans hoping people forget their record. Canadians deserve better than that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890583">Our new Liberal government was elected with a clear platform, a platform that promised to strengthen bail, support victims, resource prosecutors and invest in prevention. Canadians chose that platform and gave us the mandate to deliver, and that is exactly what we are doing in this session.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890584">Let us acknowledge that crime is a serious problem. Let us commit to keeping repeat violent offenders off the streets. Let us strengthen sentencing for violent crimes and drugs. However, let us also recognize that one bill is not the answer. A safer Canada requires a safer justice system at every level. It requires prevention, prosecution and protection, and that is exactly what our government is delivering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890585">Our forthcoming legislation on strengthening bail reform and sentencing is part of a broader suite of public safety measures. Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, the strong borders act, would add 1,000 border security agents and 1,000 new federal RCMP officers. It has additional measures that would give police the tools they need to bring international criminals to justice. It would strengthen our borders to keep U.S. firearms off the streets of our cities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890586">Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, the combatting hate act, would add new provisions to protect vulnerable communities from targeted hate at places of worship and community centres. It would also classify as a hate crime the use of terrorist symbols such as those of Hamas and Hezbollah, which are sometimes used to promote hate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890587">I want to take a moment to reflect on my record as a municipal councillor for the City of Hamilton, Canada's eighth-largest city, where I worked closely with law enforcement partners at the Hamilton Police Service. I want to thank the chief of police and the senior leadership team in Hamilton for their invaluable insight and leadership. I have been through the defund the police nonsense, I have been through the activist efforts to decriminalize drugs like fentanyl, cocaine and methamphetamines, and I have been through the activist efforts to allow homeless tent encampments in city parks, and it is clear that public opinion has shifted on those failed ideas. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890588">In Hamilton right now, gun crime, youth and gang violence, property crime associated with tent encampments, and public drug use are all top of mind for residents in my riding. These are all issues that require solutions beyond the federal level. Of course, federal legislation is required that sets responsible federal law on bail and sentencing, and we need to ensure that police have the tools necessary to bring criminals to justice, but that also requires the provinces to do their part. The provinces are responsible for provincial superior courts, for appointing and training justices of the peace and for funding and regulating municipalities. Municipalities have a duty to ensure that police have the tools and resources they need to uphold public safety, and even local school boards have a responsibility to make sure they work collaboratively with police to ensure that youth have an opportunity for positive interactions with police as part of the public education system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890589">In closing, it is clear that there is work to be done on bail reform and sentencing at the federal level. Our government is committed to making those changes, along with wider initiatives, in order to improve public safety across Canada.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8890604">Mr. Speaker, during the last election campaign, Canadians across the country asked us to take concrete measures to build a safer Canada. They elected a new Liberal government, and they had a clear and legitimate expectation: reform our bail system, improve public safety and ensure that our communities are safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890605">Today, I am speaking to my House of Commons colleagues, but I am also speaking to Canadians, especially those in my riding of Madawaska—Restigouche, and I want to make one thing clear: Our government intends to deliver on this promise. We are determined to take serious, rigorous, responsible action to ensure that every citizen enjoys the safety they deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890606">These commitments are deeply rooted in our thoughtful, balanced and evidence-based public safety platform. Our Liberal platform states that we intend to: fight gun violence and organized crime by cracking down on smuggling at the border and by equipping police with modern investigative tools; strengthen the bail system to keep repeat violent offenders off the streets, while respecting the charter; support victims of crime by improving services and ensuring that the justice system hears their voices; invest in prevention and community safety, including mental health care, addictions treatment and youth programs that address the underlying causes of crime; and protect Canadians from emerging threats, like human trafficking, cybercrime and increasingly sophisticated organized crime networks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890607">These are not just promises, however. Concrete actions are already under way. Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C‑2</Document>, the strong borders act, was introduced in the House in June. It will enable us to advance our new government's priorities: ensuring that Canadians are safe, strengthening our borders, combatting transnational organized crime and protecting the integrity of our immigration system. This bill builds on Canada's border plan, which has $1.3 billion in funding. This is the largest investment in border security in the history of this country. I invite my colleagues in the official opposition to work with us to ensure that this bill moves forward to committee stage. A party that claims to care about public safety should certainly want to strengthen security at our borders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890608">We also introduced Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C‑9</Document>, which will help us fight hate crimes. This bill introduces a series of targeted reforms to the Criminal Code aimed at ensuring safe access to community spaces, denouncing hate crimes, clarifying the legal meaning of the term “hatred” and criminalizing the wilful incitement of hatred against an identifiable group by displaying certain symbols of terrorism or hatred in public. This bill is designed to protect the safety and dignity of Canadians, while preserving space for lawful protest and charter-protected freedom of expression.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890609">Our government will also soon introduce ambitious and responsible legislation that will aim to strengthen Canada's bail system to make it harder for repeat violent offenders to get bail, increase penalties for the most serious repeat violent crimes, particularly those related to organized crime, break and enters, auto theft and human trafficking, and address court delays so that serious cases are dealt with quickly and victims are not retraumatized by court backlogs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890610">I would also like to highlight the collaborative approach that is key to our government's work. Over the summer, the <Affiliation DbId="318625" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> and his <Affiliation DbId="319414" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> held a series of consultations across the country. They met with provincial and territorial partners, police chiefs, peace officer associations, defence lawyers and Crown prosecutors to hear their concerns, ideas and experiences on the ground. This collaborative approach reflects a core Liberal value.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890611">We understand that the only way to strengthen the justice system is by working hand in hand with those on the front lines. These conversations will continue at the upcoming federal-provincial-territorial meeting of ministers of justice and public safety in October, where bail reform and community safety will be on the agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890612">We must all recognize that public safety is not just about repressive measures; it is also about prevention and support initiatives that address the root causes of crime.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8890613">That is why our government is investing in community programs, mental health services and addiction prevention. These efforts complement our legislative measures and strengthen the resilience of our communities. What is more, by collaborating closely with the provinces, territories and local stakeholders, we are ensuring that our measures are tailored to the specific realities of different parts of the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890614">I would also like to note that, despite our willingness to take action, we must ensure that the proposed measures fully respect the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The motion put forward today by our colleagues in the official opposition does not appear to have benefited from this in-depth reflection. The approach set out in Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document>, introduced by the Conservative Party, raises serious constitutional concerns. It would be irresponsible to rush ahead with changes to the Criminal Code without properly reviewing them. I wonder if the bill, which is sponsored by the <Affiliation DbId="322132" Type="9">leader of the official opposition</Affiliation>, actually underwent a rigorous legal analysis. Did my opposition colleagues truly take the time to verify whether this bill complies with the requirements of the charter? These are important questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890615">Effective public safety requires more than just slogans. If this bill were to be struck down by the courts, it would only increase public frustration, waste time and resources, and, above all, disappoint Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890616">The Harper government's track record reminds us that an ill-conceived reform can backfire on its own objectives. A number of Criminal Code amendments introduced by the former Conservative government were found to be unconstitutional. As a result, they did not improve public safety. On the contrary, they caused longer court delays and spread doubt and frustration in a certain segment of the public.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890617">We will not make the same mistakes. We need to stay focused on evidence-based reforms and sustained investments in policing and prevention. The Liberal approach centres on a targeted, responsible approach to reform, consistent with the charter, that runs no risk of being immediately struck down by the courts, as seems possible for Conservative opposition's Bill C-242. We have a responsibility to build a robust, balanced and sustainable legislative framework that complies with our Constitution in every way. That is how we intend to keep Canadians safe, not only in the short term but also, and I want to emphasize this, in the long term. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890618">Under our Liberal approach, community safety will also top our list of priorities without sacrificing fairness, basic rights or the effective administration of justice. We believe that we can and must do both: protect the public while respecting our constitutional obligations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890619">That is why Canadians elected us. They elected us to improve public safety, maintain confidence in the justice system and ensure that violent offenders face real, proportionate and fair consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890620">Today, I invite all parties to set partisan differences aside and work together to build a robust, compassionate and efficient justice system based on evidence and co-operation, not fear and confrontation. Canadians are watching us. They expect results, and they deserve a government that lives up to those expectations.</ParaText>

On that legislation, the Conservatives have now debated 18 plus hours, and they are not allowing it to go to committee. On the other hand, they say that crime and safety is important. I wonder if the member could provide his thoughts on that contradiction.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8890636">Madam Speaker, I am very much looking forward to the next speech, which will be offered by my friend from <Affiliation DbId="317990" Type="2">Cariboo—Prince George</Affiliation>, who I will be splitting my time with. I know he will have insights, which are always unique, and I am very much looking forward to it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890637">Across the country, Canadians are experiencing something they never thought possible in Canada: a loss of trust in their own safety. For decades, one of the things that set Canada apart was the fact that families could feel safe and secure in their own homes. Business owners could work late without fear, and children could walk to school without a second thought. This sense of security is now being replaced by fear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890638">Just yesterday, I spoke with a small business owner in my riding of Souris—Moose Mountain. She told me that, for the very first time in her life, she is afraid to go out at night. She described knowing of one individual in her community who had been arrested more than 180 times. That person had 180 arrests, and every time that person was back on the streets almost immediately. She said to me, “Our streets are not safe anymore.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890639">That sentence should stop us in our tracks, because when Canadians begin to feel unsafe in their own communities, when fear starts to dictate the way we live our daily lives, then government has failed at one of its most fundamental duties, which is to protect its citizens. That failure is a direct result of Liberal bail policies. This is why we must scrap Liberal bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890640">We need to be honest about how we made it here. The erosion of public safety is not a coincidence. It is the result of deliberate choices made by the Liberal government. When Liberals passed Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, they weakened bail conditions and lowered thresholds for release. They did this in the name of so-called fairness, but in reality what they created was a revolving door of justice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890641">Across the country, we see the same scenario playing out over and over again. A repeat violent offender is arrested, police officers do their jobs, charges are laid and then, sometimes within hours, the same offender is back on the streets free to reoffend. It is hard to describe the frustration police officers feel when they risk their lives to apprehend violent criminals only to see them walk free before the ink is even dry on the paper. That is the reality of Liberal bail. It is broken and dangerous, and it must end. It is time to scrap Liberal bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890642">Yesterday I spoke withe Estevan's chief of police, Jamie Blunden. Chief Blunden is not only responsible for law enforcement in the city, but he also sits on the national police service of Canada and the national advisory committee, where he works directly with police leaders from across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890643">Chief Blunden told me something very important. He said that police chiefs from coast to coast to coast are united in supporting this bill. They know better than anyone what it looks like on the ground when repeat offenders are automatically released. They see the victims. They see the businesses broken into time and time again. They see the toll it takes on officers who arrest the same individuals over and over, with no real consequence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890644">When the people we trust to keep us safe are speaking with one voice, we must listen. Police chiefs are saying loud and clear to scrap Liberal bail and restore public safety. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890645">We can talk about statistics. Violent crime up 39% since the Liberals took office. Gang-related homicides have doubled, and car thefts are at record highs. Behind every number is a victim. This is not compassion. This is not fairness. This is failure. It is the failure of Liberal bail. If we are to restore safety and dignity to victims, then we must scrap Liberal bail once and for all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890646">Conservatives believe in a simple principle: If someone repeatedly breaks the law and endangers the public, they should not be granted the privilege of bail. Public safety must come first. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890647">Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document>, the jail not bail act, is rooted in that principle. This legislation would ensure that repeat offenders are kept behind bars until trial, end the automatic release of criminals who have proven time and time again that they have no respect for the law, and put the rights of victims and communities ahead of the rights of repeat offenders. This bill is not about vengeance. It is about safety, deterrence and restoring faith in our justice system. It is about replacing a failed policy with a common-sense one. It is about making a clear choice to scrap Liberal bail and replace it with Conservative common sense.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8890648">Sometimes people think that crime is a big-city problem, something happening only in Toronto, Vancouver or Montreal, but that is not true anymore. It is also in communities like Estevan, Weyburn and Moosomin. Residents are telling me the same thing: Crime is growing, repeat offenders are emboldened and people feel unsafe in their own neighbourhood. When rural Canadians who have taken pride in their safety in their close-knit towns start telling their MPs they are afraid to leave their own house after dark, that should be a warning sign for the rest of the country. This is not just about big cities; it is about every community, every neighbourhood and every Canadian.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890649">That is why it is time to scrap Liberal bail. Victims' rights must come first. It is worth reminding ourselves that our justice system is not meant to protect only the rights of the accused; it must also protect the rights of victims. Victims deserve to feel that justice is being done. Communities deserve to feel that the system is working to keep them safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890650">Right now, under the Liberal catch-and-release system, victims are left feeling abandoned, and communities are left feeling vulnerable. Conservatives believe that this is the time to put the rights of victims and the safety of communities back at the centre of our justice system. To do that, we need to end the failed experiment of catch-and-release. We need to scrap Liberal bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890651">Public safety is the first duty of government. The very first duty of any government is to keep its citizens safe. Everything else, our prosperity, our freedoms and our sense of community, depends on that foundation. The Liberals have neglected that duty. They have chosen ideology over common sense. They have chosen to prioritize repeat offenders over the safety of ordinary Canadians, and Canadians are paying the price.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890652">However, Conservatives are offering a different path: a path where dangerous repeat offenders are held accountable; a path where police officers are supported, not undermined; and a path where business owners, parents and seniors can feel safe again in their communities. That path starts when we scrap Liberal bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890653">It is important to remember that bail was never meant to be automatic. The original intent of bail was to balance two things: the presumption of innocence and the protection of society. When someone posed a clear risk to the community, bail was never supposed to be granted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890654">What the Liberals have done is strip away that balance. They have tilted the system so heavily in favour of offenders that the protection of society has been forgotten. That is why Canadians are seeing violent repeat offenders back on the street time and time again. That is why victims are losing faith. That is why police are calling for change. To restore the balance, we must return to common sense, and that means it is time to scrap Liberal bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890655"> I return to the words of my constituent, the small business owner who told me she is afraid to walk outside at night. That fear should never be normal in Canada. I also return to the words of Chief Jamie Blunden, who told me that police chiefs across the country support the bill. When citizens and law enforcement are both calling for the same thing, the House has a duty to act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890656">The Liberals have chosen leniency and ideology, and this has left Canadians vulnerable. Conservatives choose accountability, common sense and public safety. The choice before us is clear: protect Canadians or protect criminals. Conservatives are choosing Canadians. Conservatives are choosing public safety. Conservatives are choosing to scrap Liberal bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890657">I urge all members of the House to support Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document>, the jail not bail act. Canadians deserve to feel safe again in their home, their street and their community.</ParaText>

As a matter of fact, we have had a community declare a state of emergency because of five or six prolific offenders who commit over 90% of the crime. I did say that.

He is a repeat offender with a long rap sheet: 19 court appearances since 2021, and 27 criminal charges since 2006, including assaults, death threats, breach of probation and even a sexual assault. He is committing these heinous crimes in our community. He destroyed a long-standing brewery in our community, and the owners, Daryl Leiski and Cindy Zurowski, had this to say: </ParaText>

The reality is that, at the end of the day, what we are talking about is keeping people safe from crime and making sure that there are no more victims. I cannot imagine how anyone could possibly have sat here today, listened to the debate and heard all the examples that were given of people who have lost their life, of children who have been sexually assaulted, and of home invasions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890712"> All these things happened because of the Liberals' policy of allowing bail for serious criminals over and over again. The crime stats have been cited many times today. When we look behind those stats, it is people who have been victimized, and they have been victimized by the same offenders who continue to reoffend over and over again, only because of the policies of the government that allow them back out on the street with what is called a revolving door justice system.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8890726">Madam Speaker, welcome to Adjournment Proceedings, where I will be taking up a question I asked on June 4 of this year. As members will recall, Parliament had only recently resumed. I had intended to ask a different question, but someone had called my office and caught my wonderful chief of staff on the phone. As the caller was explaining that she was living with disabilities and could not figure out how she was going to feed her children, she started to cry on the phone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890727">When the minister responded to me, she made the assumption that this was a constituent of mine, but I do not know where Tina lives. She called our office and changed my question that day because I just had to know. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890728">We had been working so hard in this place and in the previous Parliament. My friend, the former member for Kitchener Centre, Mike Morrice, had worked incredibly hard with other advocates for people with disabilities from all sides of the House. We worked to try to get a commitment and the legislation through to ensure that we would have a Canada disability benefit. We knew that it was about to start being mailed out at that point, in July. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890729">There was sadness at the tragedy of it all because we had been promised by ministers in the previous government that when we got the bill through it would lift Canadians with disabilities up out of poverty. However, hearing Tina, living with disabilities, crying on the phone because she could not figure out how to feed her children, I knew that the cheques that were going to start going out in the month of July would max out at $200 a month. That was not going to lift people up out of poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890730">Therefore, my question that day was this: Now that the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was raising the urgency of having nation-building projects, could the government, please, not make lifting all Canadians with disabilities out of poverty a nation-building project?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890731">The answer I received was not from a minister responsible for disabilities, and the minister who responded, actually the <Affiliation DbId="318701" Type="96">Minister of Jobs</Affiliation>, misnamed the program that I was talking about. It is the Canada disability benefit, not credit. However, the response was not adequate. That is why we sometimes send in slips and say we would like to discuss this in the Adjournment Proceedings. Yes, as the minister said, it is important to work with provinces and territories to ensure that money will not be clawed back, but there needs to be much more done by the federal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890732"> For example, we need to increase the benefit amount. That is pretty basic. We need to broaden eligibility so people can automatically get their Canada disability benefit if they are already receiving other disability-related benefits. It should be individual income, not household income, that determines when the Canada disability benefit is sent. It is not the income of the people they live with; it is for them. We need to raise the income threshold and the working income exemption. We need to do these things to ensure that the Canada disability benefit lifts people with disabilities out of poverty. We should make sure there are no clawbacks and no reductions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890733">I am still proud of the work that we did, and I want to again mention Mike Morrice. More than half of the amendments accepted to the bill were his amendments, including the one to ensure that this benefit be indexed to inflation. However, if they index $200 to inflation, they are not going very far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890734">I will wrap up here and hope for a better answer tonight and a real sign of commitment.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8890735">Madam Speaker, I thank my friend opposite for her advocacy for Canadians with disabilities. I am sure we all share her concern. Every barrier, be it physical or attitudinal, is a barrier to the well-being of persons with disabilities, especially to their mental and financial well-being. Allow me to bring colleagues up to date.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890736">The application portal for the Canada disability benefit opened on June 20, and payments were distributed in July. Low-income persons who were eligible for the disability tax credit, between the ages of 18 and 64, could apply either online, by phone or in person at a Service Canada office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890737">This new monthly benefit provides a maximum of $2,400 in financial support per year, per person, and is expected to improve the financial security of more than 450,000 working-age Canadians with disabilities in 2025-26. To date, over 186,000 people are already receiving the benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890738">People who have filed their 2024 tax return and who are potentially eligible for the benefit received an official letter from the Government of Canada inviting them to apply. The government has also funded community-based navigator services across the country to help individuals who need assistance applying for the Canada disability benefit, the DTC and other provincial and territorial benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890739">The federal government has engaged extensively with provinces and territories, and called on them to exempt CDB payments from counting as income in relation to their income support programs. It continues to engage with provinces and territories with a view to maximizing the benefits of the CDB to eligible persons with disabilities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890740">Budget 2024 committed $6.1 billion over six years and $1.4 billion ongoing for the Canada disability benefit. I should remind the member for <Affiliation DbId="317902" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> that, in the spirit of “nothing without us”, the Government of Canada developed the benefit in consultation with more than 8,000 Canadians, including persons with disabilities, disability stakeholders, indigenous governments and organizations, and provincial and territorial governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890741">This benefit will make a difference because we know that persons with disabilities are more likely to live in poverty than their working-age peers without disabilities. This is due to economical and social exclusion, barriers to employment and other factors. Disability is expensive. People who live with a disability or support someone who has a disability know this all too well. Disability should not equal poverty, and that is why we have created the Canada disability benefit.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8890749">Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to take up the question I had during question period a little while ago. It was about the hard-working men and women at Evraz steel, the steel plant in Regina, Saskatchewan, and the fact that they have continually had to lay off more and more workers because there is just not as much work as there used to be back in the good old days, one might say. We have had years of policies put forward by the Liberal government, such as Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document>, the shipping ban; Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, the “no more pipelines” law; and the emissions cap, which has been shown to really affect the resource industry in our country. My colleague for <Affiliation DbId="317688" Type="2">Calgary Midnapore</Affiliation> said it very well: We have seen a thousand people getting laid off in Calgary recently. We have seen mills being closed in B.C. because of the tariffs on softwood lumber.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890750">I know there are five projects from the Major Projects Office that have been announced. The question I focused on was this: If these get built, first and foremost, they should be built with Canadian steel, Canadian product and Canadian labour. This is one of the questions I would like to follow up on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890751">The other one is this: Five projects were announced, but there are still 38 major projects at the impact assessment phase. Over the last few years, according to my numbers, 86,000 jobs and $54 billion have fled the country in investment in our energy sector. TransCanada, for example, is building pipelines, just not in Canada; they are in the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890752">I would like a couple of answers to the questions I laid out. They are fair, and they are non-partisan. I think there is something we need to work on to grow our energy and our resource industry as a major economic driver. Along with that would be our agriculture industry as well. We have seen fertilizer reduction targets. We have seen industrial carbon tax. We have seen carbon tax 2.0 being added to farming. This has increased farmers' cost of doing business, and we have then seen the price of food go up also.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890753">I would love an answer from my colleague from across the way, and I will follow up in a minute.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8890754">Madam Speaker, yes, we will be looking to use more Canadian steel and more Canadian materials in general as the <Affiliation DbId="318679" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> has said. Yes, the government will support pipelines that are in the national interest and meet environmental and social standards, as well as those that meet the bedrock requirement for meaningful indigenous engagement. ln fact, Ksi Lisims LNG, recently approved, will see Canadian natural gas produced and liquefied at the highest environmental standards, and this will travel by pipeline to access new markets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890755">I want to take this opportunity to talk about business more broadly, and the One Canadian Economy Act. I think it is pertinent to the overall thrust of the query. With the support of members opposite, our government has created a clear pathway for projects of national interest. Practical changes mean approvals are faster and simpler, and proponents are provided more certainty while standards are upheld. The member opposite may not know this, but l have done work for many energy companies and worked on many major pipeline projects in my career, such as northern gateway, energy east and TMX, to name the most notable. If we are moving oil and gas, pipelines are the safest, most economical and most environmentally friendly way to do so, and they require a lot of steel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890756">The energy industry will be healthy if we continue to develop our resources to high environmental and social standards, as our trading partners increasingly demand and as Canadians expect. Courts have also demanded, and rightly so, that we meet our moral and treaty obligations to first nations, and the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been clear that this will be an expectation for all major projects. I want to caution, though, that a blanket “yes all pipelines, all the time, without a thought to the specifics” approach is not what Canadians call for or what the courts will allow, and that would not serve Canada's energy sector or Canadian workers, whether in steel or in other sectors. Projects must be reviewed on their merits: economic, social, environmental and legal. A balanced Canadian approach is called for, such as the one laid out in our new One Canadian Economy Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890757">Results are already showing; this is the positive. Investment and investor interest are being drawn to Canada. Projects are being advanced all the time. These projects mean jobs. I already mentioned Ksi Lisims LNG, but we also have LNG Canada phase 2 and Cedar LNG as concrete examples. Pathways plus, a strategy with the Major Projects Office, would increase global competitiveness for the oil and gas industry and support market diversification by positioning Canadian energy as the cleanest barrel of oil on the world market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890758">Talking of ripping up environmental assessments is a move that would only drive investment away and increase risk for Canadian workers. It is not accurate to say that no pipelines were built by the last Liberal government, as was in the original query. The most economically consequential pipeline in decades, TMX, was built, but it is true that pipeline projects have faced challenges. An honest assessment will include that the Harper government fought too much with provinces and courts. They put too little attention into the duty to consult, treating it superficially, as well as too little care into the environment and due process. As a result, not one pipeline to tidewater was built in that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890759">Let us calibrate on a balanced Canadian approach. We must respect provinces and indigenous rights holders. We must have clear timelines and certainty, and we must go faster. We must do the things that are now possible under Bill <Document DbId="13547622" Type="3">C-5</Document> and the new Liberal government. Our new approach means workers in Regina producing the steel, indigenous communities partnering as owners and Canadian innovators providing to the world the innovations we will compete and win on. I think that is something we can all support. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8890761">First of all, the Harper government built four pipelines. The only difference was that it used private money. The Liberals used $38 billion of taxpayers' money. Second, the member said that their one economy is already showing results, but 1,000 people were laid off in Calgary. That is probably not the result he wants. I would say the results have definitely been found lacking.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8890767">Madam Speaker, I am here tonight to urge the federal government to make the establishment of a sovereign aerial firefighting capacity fleet a core nation-building investment in the upcoming federal budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890768">Wildfires across Canada are increasing in both intensity and cost, demanding bold and timely action. We saw fires rage across Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland this last summer. This past fire season may not have been a record season for British Columbia, but it was certainly a record in terms of the extraordinary amount of equipment loaned from British Columbia to other provinces to help them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890769">I want to congratulate and thank the Province of British Columbia and Minister Ravi Parmar, the Minister of Forests, for prioritizing homes and people's lives in other provinces to ensure that their lives were protected and for ensuring that B.C. loaned the equipment in a timely way. That reality underlines the urgency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890770">Without a national air tanker fleet, provinces are left to shoulder the cost of aviation resources, with no guarantee that they will be available when and where they are needed most. Combatting wildfires in the climate crisis era requires a wartime level of effort. Other nations have demonstrated that repurposing retired military aircraft into civilian firefighting roles provides exactly the kind of rapid-response capability and national resilience that Canada currently lacks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890771">Canada has a rare opportunity to follow this proven model. By converting our retired CC-130H Hercules fleet into modern air tankers, we can protect communities, safeguard critical infrastructure and reduce the catastrophic carbon emissions released during mega fires. This approach would also ensure that retired military assets continue to serve Canadians in peacetime through life-saving civilian use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890772">Partnering with the private sector and first nations to retrofit a portion of the retired CC-130H Hercules fleet would create a permanent national capacity to fight wildfires. A Port Alberni-based company in my riding, Coulson Aviation, has already demonstrated global expertise in converting CC-130 aircraft and operating them as large air tankers, successfully partnering with governments in Australia, the United States and beyond.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890773">I am therefore calling on the federal government to partner with the private sector, in collaboration with first nations partners, to retrofit a portion of Canada's retired CC-130H Hercules aircraft into large air tankers for wildfire suppression; to deploy these aircraft as part of a strengthened national wildfire response capacity, shared with provinces and territories, using them, where appropriate, for international humanitarian and emergency missions; and to prioritize this made-in-Canada solution that leverages Canadian aviation expertise, protects lives and communities and safeguards the environment. In addition to strengthening our wildfire response, these investments would create high-skilled jobs in Canada's aviation sector, support innovation in emergency response technology and enhance Canada's ability to contribute to our NATO commitments and provide mutual aid abroad in times of crisis.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890774">I am strongly encouraging the minister and the government to ensure that funding for sovereign aerial firefighting capacity is included in the next federal budget. We cannot wait. Such an investment would save lives, strengthen our communities and build long-term resilience for Canada in the face of the climate crisis.</ParaText>

I would also remind the House that as a result of Canada's world-class aerospace industry, the De Havilland water bombers are in high demand, and delivery may be a few years away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890781">We need to be mindful that long-term resilience goes hand in hand with short-term readiness. However, Canadian industry also has strong abilities in retrofitting existing aircraft to serve firefighting purposes, and they continue to be valuable tools to fight wildfires across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8890782">Our government contributes to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, whose valuable work ensures that firefighting resources from the federal government, provinces and territories, and international partners are where they need to be, when they need to be there, to protect communities.</ParaText>
