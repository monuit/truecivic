              <ParaText id="8887310"> Mr. Speaker, to borrow a line, Jim Bradley was as “constant as the northern star”. From when he was first elected to city council in 1970, few can remember a time when Jim was not serving our community. He was elected to Queen's Park in 1977, becoming the second longest-serving MPP in Ontario's history, and served as Niagara's regional chair until his death.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887311">As environment minister, he shaped the province by securing agreements to end acid rain and introducing the blue box program. In St. Catharines, his legacy is everywhere, from the widening of the QEW to our new hospital and the Performing Arts Centre, and so many others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887312">Jim's dedication was unmatched. He went to everything. If someone was at a community event over the last half century, the odds are that Jim was there. His great strength was knowing what mattered to regular folks, not just to what he called the chattering class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887313">I will miss my friend. I will miss our phone calls, his sage advice and our bemoaning about our beloved Blue Jays. Rest in peace, Jim. He served St. Catharines with distinction, dignity and heart.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887314">Mr. Speaker, after 10 years of Liberals, Canadians are not safe anymore. Violent crime is up 55%, gun crime is up 130%, and extortions are up 330%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887315">Recently, the Swift 1200 radio station in Surrey was shot up, which was allegedly tied to extortion. A Calgary family reached out to me to say their house and business were shot up, and that was also tied to extortion. The Liberals' soft-on-crime policies have turned Canada into a lawless land where violent repeat criminals get bail easily. Liberals are now targeting law-abiding, trained, tested and licenced hunters, farmers and sport shooters in a $750-million gun-grab scheme. Even the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> admits this scheme does nothing to stop crime and is nothing more than a Liberal, taxpayer-funded vote grab.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887316">The Liberals need to scrap the gun grab now. Instead of hug-a-thug policies, Conservatives have proposed common-sense bills, such as the jail not bail act, which would keep our streets safe. If the Liberals are serious about getting tough on crime, they will pass these bills now to keep Canadians safe.</ParaText>

He does not have to tell his family he does not know how they will pay the mortgage or put groceries on the table. To add insult to injury, it is rumoured that Imperial's headquarters are being sold off to none other than Brookfield. Not only did the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> cause this demise, but he could also be profiting from it. The truth comes out.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887351">Last week, I talked to Danielle, the mom of number 22 Olivia Apps, about the struggles that athletes face in their pursuit to compete at the highest level. The challenging road that female athletes climb is familiar to me. In 2003, I had the privilege of playing for Canada at the world cup of lacrosse, a path that was created by the female athletes who came before me. Now, in 2025, the Canadian women's rugby team has undoubtedly paved the way for future generations of female athletes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887352"> Today, I rise to not only congratulate the team's players but also to thank them. I thank them not only as a woman and a female athlete but also as the mother of a one-year-old daughter who will grow up watching the strength of female athletes on the world stage at sold-out stadiums. My hope is that her generation will see this as the way things have always been, but we will know. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887544">Mr. Speaker, northern Ontario was hit with devastating job news this week when Kap Paper in Kapuskasing announced plans to close its mill, affecting 200 jobs directly and many more indirectly. The company is blaming a lack of federal supports for this decision, saying that although a program was announced months ago to help, nothing is going to be available in time to save this mill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887545">This is completely ridiculous. It is incompetence at its worst. Why have the Liberals broken their promise to these workers by making big, grand announcements and then leaving northern Ontario abandoned?</ParaText>

I believe that if you put it to the member in that fashion, she might have been there at the very tail end, but she was not in her seat while the question had started to be read. If members have to be in their seat at the time at which the question is being read from the beginning, then her vote should not count.</ParaText>

Petitioners in the Swan Valley want to see the end to the Liberals' reckless catch-and-release policies so that criminals can stay behind bars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887576"> This is why the people of Swan River are demanding jail, not bail, for violent repeat offenders. I support the good people of Swan River.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887583">These petitioners draw the attention of the House to the fact that 10 years ago, in a speech, the Prime Minister referred to what he himself called the “tragedy of the horizon”.

The Prime Minister called for such regulations 10 years ago, he promised to bring them in during the election campaign, and now he needs to take action.</ParaText>

They note that while more and more indigenous people are seeking to learn their languages, including survivor Clara from Hupacasath First Nation, whom I walked with yesterday and who is learning her language and never had an opportunity, the number of fluent speakers continues to fall. The petitioners further raise concerns that recent changes to federal funding put language preservation and revitalization at risk. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8887621">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to request an emergency debate on the government's proposal to dismantle Canada Post services and the growing national response to these deeply concerning changes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887622">Canada Post is older than Canada itself. It connects communities across this vast country and serves as a vital lifeline for hundreds of northern, indigenous and rural communities. At a time when our economy and sovereignty face mounting threats from Donald Trump, national institutions, such as Canada Post, are essential to our unity and our resilience.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887623">Without a doubt, Canada Post is facing serious challenges. These challenges require thoughtful, transparent and inclusive solutions. Postal workers and their union have repeatedly put forward constructive proposals to modernize and strengthen the service, yet their voices have been ignored. In 2015, the Liberal Party promised to reverse Stephen Harper's plan to end door-to-door delivery. It called its approach “real change”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887624">In 2018, then minister Carla Qualtrough led a two-phase, evidence-based review of Canada Post and unveiled what she called a “renewed vision” for the corporation, one that pledged to put service to Canadians at the heart of its mandate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887625">However, that vision was never implemented, and that promise has since been abandoned. Without any mention during the last election campaign, and without any debate in the House, the government recently announced drastic cuts to Canada Post services, including ending daily home mail delivery, closing rural post offices and eliminating door-to-door delivery for millions of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887626">These changes would mean fewer services for Canadians and significant job losses at a time when unemployment remains high. They would also very much hurt businesses in this country, including small businesses. They would disproportionately harm seniors, persons with disabilities and residents of rural and remote communities, those who rely most on accessible, dependable postal services and who are least able to absorb the impact of these cuts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887627">What is more, the government made this announcement in the midst of collective bargaining negotiations between Canada Post and its workers. Dropping such a sweeping restructuring plan into the middle of that process is like dropping a bomb. It constitutes direct interference and shows a fundamental lack of respect for collective bargaining and workers' rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887628">Tens of thousands of postal workers are now on picket lines across the country. Mail and parcels are not being processed or delivered, and post offices are closing. Today, on Parliament Hill, workers and allies rallied to defend good jobs and a strong, public postal service, reinvigorated with revenue streams for the future. They rally to send a clear message: Postal workers deserve better and Canadians deserve better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887629">The House must not remain silent. We must have a rigorous, honest and urgent discussion about the future of Canada Post and about how to protect and strengthen it, for the benefit of all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887630">That is why I am calling on the Speaker to grant an emergency debate on this critical issue for this most cherished institution.</ParaText>

Even though Canada Post and its employees have been negotiating for two years, the government intervened in the negotiations, leading to a general strike by postal workers, which has had a significant impact on the entire population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887632">People waiting for cheques from the Quebec government will have to go to a Quebec service centre to pick them up. There has been a negative impact on the distribution of medication outside major centres. Distribution services for thousands of small and medium-sized businesses have been shut down. Passports are stuck in post offices. The general election in Newfoundland and Labrador has been postponed. Municipal elections in Quebec are at risk. Some 55,000 Canada Post workers are on strike, wondering if they will still have a job tomorrow. All this because the government did not see fit to hold consultations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887633">That is why we believe it is essential to hold an emergency debate so that we can work together to find solutions to the conflict that began on September 25.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887636">I am now ready to rule on the question of privilege raised on September 15, 2025, by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="317911" Type="2">Kamloops—Thompson—Nicola</Affiliation> concerning members' access to federal penitentiaries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887637">In raising the question of privilege, the member alleged that he and the member for <Affiliation DbId="318228" Type="2">Cloverdale—Langley City</Affiliation> had been obstructed and treated disrespectfully during a visit to Fraser Valley Institution on July 28, 2025.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887638">He argued that section 72 of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act was enacted to enable members to supervise what is happening in penitentiaries. He also explained that this visit was made to fulfill his responsibilities, including his role as the opposition shadow minister for public safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887639">The member admitted that he was granted access to the institution, but he asserted that the constant presence of an assistant warden, which was imposed despite his explicit request to visit the facility with uniformed correctional officers only, inhibited his conversations with staff and inmates by creating an intimidating environment and preventing candid discussion. The member stated that this obstruction interfered with his ability to fully prepare for the proceedings of the House, including the development of questions and motions, and lines of questioning at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887640">On September 16, the member for <Affiliation DbId="318228" Type="2">Cloverdale—Langley City</Affiliation> rose in support of her colleague’s allegations. She pointed out that members have a duty to directly oversee public institutions to ensure that incarcerated persons are treated with dignity and respect.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887641">On September 18, the <Affiliation DbId="319413" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons</Affiliation> responded. He stated that there was no clear connection between the members' visit to the penitentiary and their parliamentary duties. He noted that this visit was not officially sanctioned by the House or a committee. While the Parliamentary Secretary acknowledged that it was regrettable that the members believed they were not treated with due respect, he added that there were likely protocols in place to have visitors escorted. Since the members were allowed to enter and tour the facility, no intimidation or obstruction took place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887642">Before going any further, I believe it is appropriate to review the wording of section 72 of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, which the member for <Affiliation DbId="317911" Type="2">Kamloops—Thompson—Nicola</Affiliation> referred to:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887644">The access to penitentiaries granted to parliamentarians and to judges, incidentally, is nothing new. In the United Kingdom, these visits are believed to have canonical origins that date back centuries. In Canada, they are mentioned in legislative provisions from before Confederation, as well as in Parliament’s 1868 Penitentiary Act. At the time, the right to visit was granted not only to members of Parliament but also to many public office holders, including the Governor General, the lieutenant governors, the members of the federal cabinet and others. These visiting rights remained in place thereafter, set out in various laws, before being repealed in 1961. Parliamentarians’ visits to federal penitentiaries subsequently fell under a directive of the commissioner of the correctional service.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887645">Visiting rights were restored to statutory form in the current section 72 of the act with the overhaul of the prison law in 1992. Note that, while the bill was before Parliament, an amendment that would have given parliamentarians full access to any person in a penitentiary at any time was debated. However, the House rejected that proposal and passed the current wording.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887646">In a ruling delivered on April 29, 1971, concerning a member who had been denied access to a penitentiary, which can be found on page 5338 of the Debates, Speaker Lamoureux offered the following explanation, and I quote:</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> On a number of occasions I have defined what I consider to be parliamentary privilege. Privilege is that which sets hon. members apart from other citizens giving them rights which the public do not possess. I suggest we should be careful in construing any particular circumstance which might add to the privileges which have been recognized over the years and perhaps over the centuries as belonging to members of the House of Commons.... It seems to me that the fact that the Penitentiary Act in the past, until 1961 I believe, did provide for a right on the part of members to make visits is an indication that if it were part of parliamentary privilege, it would not have been included in the statutes. </QuotePara>

Therefore, the Chair cannot find that there is a prima facie question of privilege.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887660">Mr. Speaker, with my limited time, I will do a bit of an overview. When we look at the issue of combatting hate, we see that the legislation is substantive and would in fact make a significant difference in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887661">I would also suggest that one needs to look at the last election, where there was a commitment to bring forward legislation of this nature. I say that because the election was not that long ago. A new <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and new government were elected based on a series of commitments. Those commitments, at least in part, to date, have come in the form of legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887662"> I could talk about Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, the stronger borders legislation; Bill <Document DbId="13539746" Type="3">C-4</Document>, the middle class tax break for Canadians; Bill <Document DbId="13547622" Type="3">C-5</Document>, the one Canada economy legislation; Bill <Document DbId="13563649" Type="3">C-8</Document>, the critical cyber-system legislation; or Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, which we are debating today, about hate crime. It is very real and very tangible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887663">With that mandate, not only the government was given a responsibility, but so were all opposition members. It was a very clear mandate given to all of us. Canadians want and expect that their parliamentarians here in Ottawa will work co-operatively in order to have legislation and budgetary measures pass through the system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887664">My appeal to all members of the House is to recognize the mandate that was given to us by Canadians: Legislation like we are debating today, other pieces of legislation that we have already introduced, or legislation such as our bail reform, which is going to be coming out shortly, should all be allowed to get to the committee stage. That is what is in the best interest of Canadians. This is not to limit debate, because we still have third reading and all sorts of debate and consultations that take place in our standing committees.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887665">With respect to the legislation before us today, it is important that we recognize how much racism and hatred have increased over the last number of years. Race or ethnicity is number one in terms of hate, followed by religion and by sexual orientation. Those are the big three.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887666">Hate happens every day in communities throughout Canada. It is one of the reasons it is so critically important that we not only recognize the legislation as a commitment that was part of our electoral platform but also recognize that communities are hurting and that the bill is legislation that would advance more peaceful communities. I would encourage all members to support it.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887681">I will be splitting my time with my dear friend, the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="318054" Type="2">Bowmanville—Oshawa North</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887682">I will speak about Gardiner and Voltaire: one an English journalist and the other a French satirist. A.G. Gardiner, in his essay <I>On the Rule of the Road</I>, put it plainly: One's freedom ends where the other person's nose begins. One's right to swing their fist ends when it collides with another's safety. To live together, we accept this social contract, curbing certain impulses so that everyone may move freely. Gardiner used simple ideas like the limits of playing a trombone at midnight to illustrate the point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887683">True freedom comes with the responsibilities of restraint, rules and tolerance. Without responsibilities, liberties clash and dissolve into anarchy, where no one is free. With these responsibilities, we achieve freedom for all, including minorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887684">Voltaire, in his writings and satire, came to the same truth from another perspective. For him, freedom of speech was the lifeblood of progress. A society advances when ideas, even unpopular ones, can be expressed and tested. He fought censorship, knowing that suppression is always the tool of tyranny. A phrase often attributed to him, “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it”, was in fact penned later by Evelyn Beatrice Hall. Voltaire defended free expression, while rejecting incitement, libel and sedition, insisting that open dialogue is the only safeguard of liberty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887685">Taken together, Gardiner and Voltaire remind us that freedom lives in the balance in between. Without restraint, it collapses into anarchy, and without expression, into tyranny. It is against this balance that we must measure the state of our country today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887686">Taking into account the understanding that Gardiner and Voltaire provide us with, let us chart out Canada in the last decade and provide three principal critiques of Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>. The hate crime legislation before us right now is legislation that we should have been debating several years ago. We will take no lessons from Liberals when it comes to fighting hate. Let us talk about the last decade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887687">Since 2015, when the Liberals took office, hate crimes have gone up 258%, police-reported hate crimes have increased six years in a row and anti-Semitic hate crimes are up 416%. We have a government in place that has allowed Jewish Canadians, who account for less than 1% of our population, to become the most-targeted minority in our country. Seventy per cent of all hate crimes are targeted at less than 1% of the population. It is a government that, for far too long, has decided to place political expediency over moral clarity, choosing appeasement over principle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887688">A synagogue was fire-bombed twice in one year. Two Jewish schools were shot up. A bomb threat targeted Jewish institutions across Canada. A Jewish man was assaulted in a Montreal park. A Jewish woman was stabbed in the kosher section of an Ottawa Loblaws. The government's announcement, on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, of granting a state to the people who practise state terror as statecraft, emboldening mobs and violence upon our Jewish communities, is just the latest example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887689">It has been a decade of waiting for the rule of law over mob rule. Christians across our country have been subjected to over 100 church bombings and attacks. Communities are divided against one another as political projects of Liberals, rather than as a country being raised on the basis of the rule of law for all its people. Truckers took to our streets to protest for their rights and freedoms, as the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> then betrayed civil liberty and sowed distrust in our financial institutions, calling those very protesters seditious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887690">Trust is broken in this country. Our institutions, whether media, bureaucratic, judicial, financial or academic, have all been subjected to radical conformity, not critical thinking. The rot of one ideology as supreme against all others has shaken the confidence of Canadians, and restoring that trust requires much more than the performance art and virtue signalling that much of Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> presents.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8887691">The same Liberal members of Parliament who stood and watched as trust eroded and communities were torn apart stand here today to claim that they have solutions for the very problems they caused. They claim they have majestically changed since their new <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office. We cannot forget the damage and division they sowed, the trust they have broken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887692"> It is against the backdrop of the rising hate and violence the Liberals have caused that I offer three three principal critiques of Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>. First is the removal of the Attorney General from the process of approving charges for hate crimes. The requirement for AG consent has long served as a safeguard against abuse and as a means for accountability. By removing that oversight, the government would risk giving unelected bureaucrats unchecked discretion over prosecutions, paving the way for radical ideological judges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887693">My friend, the member for <Affiliation DbId="317903" Type="2">Nanaimo—Ladysmith</Affiliation>, put it best on September 24:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887694">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Right now, our biggest problem is that enforcement is not consistent. Bail is virtually automatic, and charges are often dropped. Serious charges are plead down. That is where Parliament's attention should be: on stronger enforcement, on swifter prosecutions and on support for victims. Unamended, this bill risks punishing the unpopular while the truly dangerous slip through.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887695">Second is a question of identity. Where the bill currently refers to the protection of identity, it shifts attention away from protecting individual dignity. This carve-out from free speech would give Liberals the opportunity to define what they do not like as hate speech. Identities and human association are complex and subjective, but the concepts of the individual's rights and dignity are objective. Our laws should defend every Canadian against intimidation, harassment and violence, not protect abstract categories that are open to interpretation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887696">Third, another concern with Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> is its approach to defining “hate” itself. As drafted and as the government indicates, the bill would codify the Supreme Court of Canada's definition of “hatred” as “detestation or vilification”. On its face this seems consistent, but by removing the word “extreme”, the government would lower the legal threshold, enabling police to lay a multitude of charges with less scrutiny and less investigation. In practice, this would risk opening the floodgates to inconsistent prosecution and litigation. This is the kind of overreach we have come to expect in the United Kingdom, but not here in Canada. The Conservatives are the party of free speech, not the party of prosecuting those whose speech we do not agree with.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887697">There is a lot at stake in Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>. We must resist the left's troubling argument that words alone constitute violence. Words are words. Violence is violence. Conflating the two licenses the idea that real violence is a legitimate response to speech, a principle that is both dangerous and indefensible. The only correct response to offensive or hateful words is more words and more debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887698"> If there has been a rise in hate in Canada, it is not because we fail to police speech; it is because we fail to police actions: barricading neighbourhoods, assaulting members of religious minorities, burning down churches, shooting up synagogues or vandalizing minority-held businesses. It is because we have a government that sows division, pitting one community against another, and that treats one speech as sacrosanct and the other as seditious. It is because our government does not have the resources to act and because the Liberals have created a justice system that lets offenders walk back onto our streets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887699">The solution to violence is enforcement of the law by police and by courts, accountability for wrongdoers and genuine condemnation by public officials, none of which we have seen. Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, as written, falls short. As hate crimes have risen across this land, successive public safety and justice ministers have failed to bring focus to the source of these crimes. They have failed to provide both legal and moral leadership to stand against the mob and call for civility in Canada, honouring what Gardiner and Voltaire described. Without them, violent crimes go unchecked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887700"> It is time to jail the haters, not for what they say, but for what they do. Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> fails to strike the balance Canadians expect. Despite having had the support of the Conservatives since the election, the Liberals only table a law that would essentially repurpose an existing law and would contribute very little to dealing with one of the biggest crises our country has to confront. We must confront hatred with the rule of law and the love of liberty. We must protect Canadians from violence, not expose them to arbitrary prosecutions. We must hold the government accountable for legislation that leaves our communities vulnerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887701">That is our responsibility. That is our commitment. That is the standard Canadians expect.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8887724">Madam Speaker, freedom of expression is a special part of Canada's political and cultural tradition. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms says that everyone in our country has the following fundamental freedoms: freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression. When any government seeks to limit or constrain these freedoms, it requires a special trust between the people of the country and that government. Ideally, the people know that when a government seeks to limit their expression, that government has their best interests in mind and that any effort to limit freedom of expression would be done so fairly and justly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887725">Today, the Liberal government does not have that trust with many Canadians, and it is important that we understand why as we debate the merits of Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, in which the Liberal government is proposing new ways of limiting free expression in our dear country. A government that is deserving of trust would, of course, be one that is honest with the people of the country. Unfortunately, that is not the case with Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>. Much of this legislation is duplicative of laws already on the books and does not adequately address the core reasons crime has increased.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887726">The problem of crime primarily requires the federal government to more earnestly enforce the laws we already have and support police officers to investigate crimes and lock up criminals. The Liberal government is, frankly, taking attention away from its very real enforcement problem as it pertains to criminal law and the justice system. Instead, it is distracting people with legislation and, in doing so, is not being straight up with the people of our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887727">A government that is deserving of trust with legislation like Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> would be a government that treats all religious communities fairly, and that is not the case. In the rollout of Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, the Liberal government failed to mention anti-Christian bigotry in explaining how this legislation would address increases in hate in our country. Of course, anti-Christian bigotry has risen dramatically in recent years, as evidenced by over 100 churches being burned down or vandalized. In fact, the government's statements about Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> seem to go very far out of their way to avoid mentioning Christians and to avoid mentioning what has been happening to Christian communities across our country, despite mentioning other targeted communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887728">This is not a surprise to me, and probably not to many in this chamber, as when the Liberal government had an opportunity last year to support Conservative legislation to increase the penalty for arson against churches, which was known as Bill <Document DbId="13180878" Type="4">C-411</Document>, the Liberal government did nothing. It did not step up to work with us. It did not even articulate support for our efforts. We may recall Bill <Document DbId="13180878" Type="4">C-411</Document>, introduced by my Conservative colleague from <Affiliation DbId="318238" Type="2">Pitt Meadows—Maple Ridge</Affiliation>, introduced mandatory minimum sentences for criminals attacking churches. It was a fantastic idea and an important part of any meaningful response to what has happened to churches across our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887729">Despite claims by the current Liberal government that it is something new and different from what we contended with last year, it continues to take the exact same approach to how it deals with Christians in our country, continuing to refuse to step up and take any action. Ultimately, it is important for Christians and non-Christians across our beautiful nation to ask why the Liberals seem unwilling to address the attacks on churches in Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="13180878" Type="4">C-411</Document> or any bill for that matter. If we are being very honest, I think the answer is that the Liberals like to use their power in government to pick winners and losers. They like to decide who deserves attention and protection, who deserves to have their dignity affirmed and who does not.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8887730">Liberals, frankly, do not see Christians as deserving of protection, and Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> is a very clear example of that, plain and simple, on paper. With that in mind, it is difficult to trust the Liberals to apply these new powers they seek to limit free expression in a way that is fair, just and the same for all Canadians. I anticipate Liberals saying that Bill C-9 is responding to the needs of religious communities by including language for the protection of Canadians who attend places of worship. Believe me, Madam Speaker: I would very much like to see more protections for Canadians who attend places of worship. In August, I submitted a motion to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage to discuss precisely this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887731"> However, my concern with Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> is that the Liberals are taking a very real issue, which is that Canadians who attend places of worship need more protections, and using that very real issue to justify the expansion of their government's power to define what constitutes acceptable speech. Liberals have demonstrated, over their last decade in power, an intolerance for Christians and other Canadians who may disagree with them on important social and cultural issues. For that reason, I worry that the government will use the new powers it seeks under Bill C-9 to make it even more difficult for people in our great country to freely practise their faith.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887732">Importantly, it is not just Christians who have concerns about being excluded from Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>; Hindus across our country do as well. I have personally heard from many Hindu Canadians in Bowmanville—Oshawa North and across Durham region, who have expressed concerns over how some of their religious symbols have been characterized in Bill C-9. There is concern for many in the Hindu community that the proposed legislation equates one of their sacred symbols with a symbol of hatred. They are not being treated fairly by the Liberal government either.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887733">Finally, it is very important to note another reason many Canadians do not trust the Liberal government. Under the Liberals' watch, the justice system has become weak and ineffective at protecting our communities. To have a trusting relationship with the public, especially if it has the audacity to ask the public to allow it to limit their free expression even further, the Liberal government should prove that it is willing to listen to cries for help from police officers asking for important justice reforms. Many criminals, whether they are motivated by hate or something else, could be off the street right now if the core problems in the justice system were adequately addressed. Canada needs a justice system that will be tougher on criminals, and that means having real consequences for breaking the law and hurting our people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887734">I would like to share the words of Durham region's police chief, Peter Moreira, who offered a powerful statement on the topic of justice reform a couple of days ago. He said, “we must establish meaningful consequences that deter convicted individuals from reoffending. Offenders who endanger the public—whether through the use of weapons, threats or reckless driving—should be remanded into custody. Breaching bail conditions should disqualify individuals from future bail, especially when it's their third, fourth, or subsequent release. Bill C-75 began this dangerous trend of multiple releases.... We need justice reform that prioritizes the rights of law-abiding citizens over the 'rights' of repeat offenders.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887735">In conclusion, it is obvious to anyone paying attention why Canadians would be uncomfortable with the Liberal government asking for more power over our lives, and their time would be better spent trying to fix the justice system they have broken.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887758">In 2014, the police recorded 1,295 hate crimes. By 2024, that number had risen sharply to 4,882. Hate crimes motivated by race or ethnicity saw a particularly sharp increase, rising from 611 cases in 2014 to 2,377 cases in 2024. Similarly, hate crimes based on religion increased significantly, from 429 cases in 2014 to 1,342 cases in 2024.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887759">Since 2020, the Black community has been the most frequently targeted population for hate crimes motivated by race or ethnicity, accounting for 37% of hate crimes in 2024. In 2024, most police-reported hate crimes targeting religion were directed at the Jewish community at 68% and the Muslim community at 17%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887760">These figures and statistics tell only part of the story. The sad reality is that no community is immune to hate. We continue to hear that Canadians no longer feel safe in places of worship, learning and gathering, or in simple day-to-day life. The government is deeply concerned about this situation and has been very clear that it will take successive measures to improve public safety. Bill C-9 is the next step in this regard.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887761">Let me be very clear. Regardless of an individual's background or who they are, if Canada is their home, then they deserve to live here in peace and free of hatred.</ParaText>

Within the past two years, reports on threats and attacks at places of worship, community centres and religious schools, as well as hate-motivated crime more generally, continue to become more commonplace.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887763">To take but a few examples, reporting from Global News, CBC and the Montreal Gazette during this time includes shootings and attacks on and at synagogues and mosques, evacuations of Jewish schools and Muslim community centres because of bomb threats and reports of attacks against Muslim taxi drivers and women wearing a hijab. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887764">While these particular media stories focus on anti-Semitic and Islamophobic incidents, we know members of other communities in Canada share similar experiences of hate-motivated conduct, including because they are indigenous, because of the colour of their skin, because of the god they worship or because of who they love.

              <ParaText id="8887770"> Bill C‑9 proposes to enact four new Criminal Code offences that will provide clear but appropriate tools for investigators, Crown prosecutors and judges assigned to cases involving these offences.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887772">The bill also proposes to create an offence prohibiting anyone from intentionally impeding access to those same places.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887773"> These two new proposed offences will help ensure that police have clear tools to intervene when the behaviour of certain individuals crosses a line and becomes criminal activity in relation to these places.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887774"> To be clear, nothing in the two proposed offences would prohibit or restrict the right of individuals to protest in or near these places.

              <ParaText id="8887775"> For example, if anyone attempts to disrupt a peaceful protest through violence, police can respond appropriately without infringing on the rights of the protesters to express their opinion on a particular issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887776">To be clear on this point, the bill specifically includes a defence for any person who attends at or near a place for the sole purpose of obtaining or communicating information. This type of defence already exists for similar offences and its application is clear and well known in the context of protests and picketing activities. As long as it is done in a peaceful manner and access to the place is not significantly impacted, this behaviour would not be targeted by the new proposed offence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887777">The bill also proposes creating a new hate propaganda offence related to the public display of certain hate and terrorist symbols. I want to assure my colleagues that this is not a blanket ban on symbols, but rather an offence of limited scope that applies exclusively to the public display of symbols deliberately used to promote hate targeting identifiable groups. The offence has been carefully worded and will not apply to public displays of such symbols for legitimate purposes, such as journalistic, educational or artistic purposes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887778">In addition to these specific offences, Bill C‑9 also proposes to create a new hate crime offence. To address the overall rise of hate in Canada, this new offence would strongly denounce and deter all hate-motivated crimes. This is an important new tool for police and Crown prosecutors across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887779">The new hate crime offence would make it a criminal offence to commit unlawful acts motivated by hate based on such grounds as race, ethnic origin, religion or sex. It would apply generally to the commission of an offence under the Criminal Code or an act of Parliament and would include stiffer penalties depending on the severity of the offence.</ParaText>

                <I>Uqaqtittiji</I>, I join this debate on Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, the combatting hate act, as the voice of Nunavut and as a member of the NDP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887797">The NDP believes the federal government must take comprehensive action to fight the rising tide of hate in Canada. Almost 5,000 hate crimes were reported in 2024. Police-reported hate crimes motivated by race or ethnicity are up 19% from 2022. Yes, we need to combat hate, but we do not need to criminalize people speaking up, and we definitely do not need to keep them jailed for longer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887798">I am disappointed that this bill does not address the violent activities of the growing white nationalist movement. The Liberals' failure to include that aspect in this bill leaves racialized communities, indigenous communities and the 2SLGBTQIA+ community without the necessary tools to combat the largest source of hatred in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887799">We are in polarizing times, for many reasons. People are either for or against Palestine. They are either for or against Israel. Indeed, our political system is getting close to only being Liberal or Conservative. Our public discourse must not give us fear that we will be criminalized. Our religious beliefs should not spread hate. This bill seems to be more about criminalizing people who speak out than it is about addressing the growing racism against racialized people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887800">There are existing laws that address hate, calling into question the real purpose of this bill. Hate is already an aggravating factor in sentencing. This bill would increase maximum sentences if an offence is motivated by hate. What would that raise sentences to? It would raise them to five years, 10 years, 14 years and even up to life imprisonment. We are entering a debate where imprisonment is made easier and made longer when, at the same time, we are hearing about an impending austerity budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887801">In fact, there are already existing provisions in the Criminal Code addressing situations involving a crime near places of worship. I draw members' attention to the following sections in the Criminal Code: subsection 176(2), “Disturbing religious worship or certain meetings”; subsection 430(4.1), “Mischief relating to religious property”; section 264, “Criminal harassment”; section 264.1, “Uttering threats”; and section 423, “Intimidation”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887802">New Democrats are concerned with vague language in this bill, because once broad definitions are on the books, they can easily be weaponized against groups. For example, how will intimidating behaviours be interpreted by police? In its current form, the bill has the potential to criminalize peaceful protesters and legitimate dissent. This bill, in its current form, gives too much discretionary power to law enforcement, allowing for subjectivity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887803">We know that listing groups on the terror list is a highly political decision, ultimately up to cabinet discretion. New Democrats are concerned that the section of this bill dealing with hate symbols would create a risk that a future government could put forward a new terror list for political purposes to appease certain groups that could then be caught under this provision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887804">Let me break down some of these concerns a bit more. Surrounding law enforcement, it gives too much discretionary power to law enforcement, allowing for subjectivity. Charging people with a hate crime carries a stigma that follows the person for life. If the charge is later dropped, the stigma will remain with the person.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8887805">There is the issue of vagueness. What are intimidating behaviours? How will they be defined or interpreted by police? Once broad definitions are on the books, they can be easily weaponized against groups. Hate is already an aggravating factor in the Criminal Code of Canada, as I said earlier. An assault committed out of hatred means the sentence would already be higher than it would be otherwise. This new offence would put the consequences of hatred in the hands of the police's subjective process rather than in those of the sentencing judge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887806">Second, we have a huge American influence. Advocates want tools that would target groups that openly espouse hatred and racism, would make it illegal to conduct any sort of militant training, for example MMA fight clubs, and would address the business component that allows these groups to become incorporated and therefore fundraise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887807">On the banning of symbols, other than the swastika and SS bolts, symbols would depend on Canada's terror list. Listing groups on the terror list is a highly political decision that is ultimately up to cabinet's discretion. This creates a risk that a future government could put forward a new terror list for political purposes to appease certain groups that could then be caught under this provision.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887808">The wilful promotion of hatred is already an offence in Canada. The use of the swastika can already be processed through crimes currently on the books. The Liberals adding the Supreme Court of Canada's definition of “hatred” to the Criminal Code is not the issue. Courts already use this definition, and nothing would change with this addition. The escalating punishment after each offence for someone convicted of the new hate crime would be excessive and disproportionate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887809"> On the new state of fear threshold, Canada already has a system where we recognize that free speech can go too far and cross a line, like when it incites violence against an identifiable group. This bill would lower that threshold and focuses on elements that are easily politically influenced, like which groups we can and cannot talk about in public. That makes the New Democrats and civil liberties associations nervous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887810">This crime has the element of intent to provoke a state of fear before going into a specific location. How will these locations be easily identifiable? The definition is too broad. This would cause problems in terms of scope and clarity for peaceful protesters. Provisions are vague, creating the potential for arbitrariness. We should be worried about how police would interpret the bill and about creating a further backlog in the already overburdened criminal justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887811">On freedom of assembly, while freedom of assembly is protected under the charter, with the broad definition of “fear”, any protest that is loud enough or disruptive enough would be seen as meeting this criterion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887812">In the context of the upcoming November budget, the austerity measures the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has told us to expect will impact the justice system, potentially with cuts to public prosecution offices. At the same time, this bill would take away some roles of the Attorney General. The Liberals are making cuts to budgets and at the same time are giving departments more power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887813">With all the alarm bells going off about this bill, the NDP cannot support it in its current form. We will ensure that amendments are submitted—</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887833">Our society has changed in recent years. Change can be a good thing. None of us wants to return to a past before we had things like refrigeration and modern medicine, although I suppose there are many who wish we could return to a past without social media. I can certainly sympathize with that. It seems that as a nation, as a people, as humans, we have become much more fractured than in the past, and many of our divisions are fuelled by what we read and hear online. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887834">I do not know if Canadians today are more hateful than in the past, but it does seem that more anger and hatred are being expressed against specific groups in our society. This is a serious issue that merits serious consideration. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887835">I think every member of this House will want to speak to this bill, and some to share personal stories of their experiences with hatred in our society. There is probably not a member of an ethnic, religious, racial or sexual minority who has not at some point had to deal with irrational prejudices that threaten to expand into hatred or violence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887836">The question we need to ask ourselves in this House is how we can best respond to hatred. Legislation such as Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, the combatting hate act, may provide a Criminal Code framework for punishment, but is punishing people for their ideas and beliefs going to change those beliefs?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887837">At the same time, we have a responsibility to protect Canadians, especially vulnerable Canadians, from being harassed by those whose motivation is hate. It is our responsibility to find a balance between free speech and individual rights. We need to ask ourselves if this bill would do that. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887845">Human nature cannot be changed by legislation. Irrational hatred, because of its irrationality, would not be eliminated by passing legislation against hate crimes.

              <ParaText id="8887847">There is a fine line to be drawn between the right to protest and interference with others. I expect we will hear a lot of debate about the idea of intimidation that is brought forth in this legislation. In theory, protecting those lawfully using a school, a place of worship or any other location is a good thing. Sometimes, however, those places could be considered legitimate targets for protest. If this bill passes, it will be challenging for police and the courts to balance the rights of all involved.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8887848">Hate remains an ongoing problem in Canadian society. It is not something government can eliminate, though we have certainly tried. We have had government reports on supporting victims of hate crimes. We have had statistics telling us who has been targeted by hate in Canada. We have Canada's action plan on combatting hate. We have Canada's anti-racism strategy. The RCMP has the national hate crimes task force. However, hate is still with us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887849">In 2024, the Office of the Federal Ombudsperson for Victims of Crime released a special report entitled “Strengthening Access to Justice for Victims of Hate Crime in Canada”. It noted many of the problems we face in combatting hatred in our country. In 2023, there was a 32% increase in the number of hate crimes reported to police over the previous years. Those numbers are on the rise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887850">This is not a uniquely Canadian problem. Societies the world over are seeing increased polarization. Minority groups are being demonized for political gain. Violence is increasing. Social media is being used to fuel the fires of hatred. The ombudsman called for the federal government to step forward to provide a legal definition of a hate crime and to enact legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887851">This bill is in response to that. Definitions and laws are, in many ways, just words on paper. They do not convey the human element, the understanding of what hatred does to those who are targets of hate crimes. It is those people and their experiences that bring us to our discussion today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887852">The combatting hate act is not going to change anyone's mind. It is not going to miraculously convince all Canadians that they should love their neighbours. We, therefore, need to ensure that all Canadians are not being subjected to hate merely because of who they are or what they believe. No Canadians should be expected to live in fear for their lives or livelihood because of race or gender. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887853">No Canadian should be prevented from accessing medical treatment or attending a religious service because the building is being blocked by those spewing hateful words and symbols. Yes, we need to preserve free speech, but the Charter of Rights and Freedoms allows those freedoms “subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887854"> There is no constitutional right to promote hatred. Hate crimes are not victimless. They can cause deep psychological harm. Sometimes they can cause physical harm. They are intended to cause fear and intimidation. When we allow one group to be targeted, when we fail to act, we become complicit in the crime. I am sure none of us in the House wants that to happen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887855">Does the combatting hate act solve the problem of hatred in Canadian society? It does not. It cannot, because legislation does not change hearts and attitudes. That is something best done one on one, and a task that falls on each one of us as we are confronted with hatred. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887856">In the House, we can show our desire for a better Canada, one where people are completely accepted for who they are, regardless of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887857">Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> is intended to show society's displeasure with the actions of those who wilfully promote hatred in Canada. I am not convinced this legislation is going to be as effective as the government hopes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887867">Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to speak to Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, although I have grave concerns, not with the objective, but with the manner in which the Liberals have gone about trying to achieve it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887868">From the outset, let me say that I am grateful the Liberals have finally recognized there is a wave of hate sweeping this country. I am glad they have realized what the Jewish community in this country, among others, has been crying out for for years, which is a government that will listen to these concerns and understand the very real threats that are targeting them on a regular basis. However, just as the Liberals have done with Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> and the firearms file, they take a legitimate issue and offer a remedy that attacks the rights of citizens and expands the state’s power, often without the checks and balances necessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887869">Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> would do five things: “repeal the requirement that the Attorney General consent” to proceedings for hate charges, “create an offence of wilfully promoting hatred against any identifiable group by displaying certain symbols in a public place”, “create a hate crime offence of committing an offence...that is motivated by hatred”, “create an offence of intimidating a person in order to impede them from accessing certain places that are primarily used for religious worship” and “create an offence of intentionally obstructing or interfering with a person’s lawful access to such places.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887870">Of these five things, three are already covered by existing laws, such as creating an offence of wilfully promoting hatred by displaying a symbol. Subsection 319(2) of the Criminal Code already targets the wilful promotion of hatred. It targets the incitement of hatred, and the courts have been very broad in their interpretation of how that communication must take place. Symbols are a part of that. I can give an example from my own riding, where someone was charged, just within the last two weeks, in Central Elgin, Ontario, with a hate charge under subsection 319(2) after mowing a swastika into their front lawn. The display of a hate symbol led to a hate charge under the existing law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887871"> Creating a hate offence is also redundant because hate motivation is already an aggravating factor under section 718.2 of the Criminal Code, and it has consistently been applied by the courts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887872">Offences of intimidation and obstruction at places of worship are already criminalized under sections 423, 431 and 434.1 of the Criminal Code, as well as under the laws pertaining to threats in section 264.1.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887873">What we are left with when we strip away these three things, which are already covered by existing laws, are two things. Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> really does two things. Number one, it would remove the requirement for the Attorney General to consent. This has been viewed by activists and advocates on the left and the right in this country as a necessary safeguard against overzealous and political prosecutions by law enforcement or by Crown attorneys who simply do not understand this because it is a rarely applied provision of the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887874">The next part is the most egregious part, where I will spend the remainder of my time. The government is codifying a new definition of hate. Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> describes hatred as “the emotion that involves detestation or vilification and that is stronger than disdain or dislike”. The government has said this is adapted from the Keegstra Supreme Court decision, a seminal free expression case in Canada, but it actually changes something very key. In Keegstra, the court held that hatred “connotes emotion of an intense and extreme nature that is clearly associated with vilification and detestation.” This was expanded upon in the Whatcott decision, which says that hatred is “extreme manifestations of the emotion described by the words 'detestation' and 'vilification'.” The word “extreme” does not appear in Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887875">The government is very proud of this bill. The Liberals have had all summer to work on it, and they have had I do not know how many stakeholders, staffers, bureaucrats, lawmakers and lawyers go over every clause, I imagine, with a fine-tooth comb. Omitting an operative, very key word in a very key section of this bill is no accident. The government is, to use a legal term, wilfully lowering the threshold on what constitutes hate and, by extension, expanding the state's power and lowering the threshold of what can be regarded as free expression in this country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8887876">The reason this is so important to me and to the Canadians who have been speaking out about Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> to this point is that the government has been, to its credit, very transparent on where it wants to go on free expression.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887877">In the last two Parliaments, under the auspices of tackling so-called online harms, the Liberal government has introduced sweeping censorship bills that have been decried by voices on the left and the right. The Liberals have told us, as recently as last week, that this is coming back. The online harms bill is still very much a live issue, so we cannot look at Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> in isolation. We cannot disentangle it from the Liberal government's stated attitudes about freedom of expression and, quite frankly, the contempt in which they hold free expression and open debate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887881">We do not need to look far to see what happens when the threshold for hate is lowered. In the United Kingdom, police are not even rarely knocking on doors and arresting people over mean tweets, because the same desire that we are seeing behind some of the negative and concerning impulses in Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> is criminalizing hate based on the grounds that words are violence. Censors justify their limitations on freedom of expression by elevating speech to violence. It is not for the state to discern, let alone prosecute, hate that may exist in one's heart; the law is to punish action, and the existing laws already do this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887882">I would be remiss not to point out that the Liberals get tough on crime only when they are talking about thought criminals. These are the only people that the Liberals want to put behind bars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887883">Let us look at some of the real hate crimes across the country. According to Juno News, 130-some churches have been vandalized or victimized by arson since 2021. Synagogues in Canada have been firebombed and vandalized. Jewish schools have been shot at. If the Liberals were serious about real hate crimes, they would be seeking mandatory 10-year prison sentences for these heinous assaults on places of worship. Again, the law should punish bad behaviour and not bad feelings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887884">To be fair, we cannot confront the hatred that exists in Canada and in Canadian society without acknowledging some of the root causes of it. The crisis of hate is a direct consequence of 10 years of divisive Liberal identity politics and the reckless breaking of the immigration system by the Liberal government.

              <ParaText id="8887907">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time today with the member for <Affiliation DbId="317814" Type="2">Oshawa</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887908">I rise today to address Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, the combatting hate act, specifically the changes to subsection 319(6) and the introduction of proposed subsection 319(7) to the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887909"> I strongly support protecting religious freedom and ensuring that all Canadians are safe from hate and violence, but Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> would not do that effectively. I have three serious concerns about Bill C-9. First, it omits the protection of Christians, despite the fact that more than 100 churches have been burned and vandalized in Canada since 2021. Second, it would remove the safeguard of the Attorney General's consent under section 319. This would risk hate speech being weaponized as a political tool by any party in power by letting the government minister decide who gets charged. Third, it would water down the definition of “hatred” to something so vague and subjective that it would risk encroaching on the very right contained in subsection 2(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887910">Beginning with my first objection to Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, I find it quite perplexing that Christian hate is not even mentioned in the bill. In recent years, we have seen alarming hate-motivated attacks, including the burning and vandalism of churches across Canada. Just last week, a century-old Ukrainian Orthodox church in Edmonton was burned to the ground. As we have witnessed a record number of sacred spaces being destroyed, Christians have noticed the government's silence. Congregations have been left in fear, and people of faith are feeling abandoned by their government's lack of enforcement of existing laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887911"> In this context, it is shocking that a bill about combatting hate is completely silent on the rise of Christian hate. The government's press release mentions anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia and transphobia, yet it makes no mention of the rise in hate crimes toward Christians. This bill would not add new protections for worshippers. Instead, it would expand state powers by removing the legal safeguards and watering down the definition of hate speech. It would pave the path toward politicizing restrictions on speech. It would even risk criminalizing dissent to what some would call thought crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887912">We must exercise caution. Once such powers are granted to the government, they can be weaponized by any government against its critics. The existing Criminal Code already covers the most serious offences. Section 318 makes it a crime to advocate for or promote genocide. Section 319 criminalizes public incitement to hatred, wilful promotion of hate and speech that would lead to a breach of peace. These provisions already strike a careful balance between protecting Canadians from true hate and safeguarding freedom of expression. Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> attempts to redefine hatred so vaguely that it would risk capturing legitimate debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887913">We have seen how this plays out elsewhere in the world. In the U.K., a man was arrested for holding a blank protest sign because authorities said it could be interpreted as offensive. In Australia, parents were investigated for hate speech after questioning gender policies at their school. In New Zealand, academics were threatened with jail for quoting banned manifestos. Canada is not immune.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887914">We are crossing a dangerous line of removing the provincial Attorney General's consent and oversight and leaving charges in the hands of a minister appointed by the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The Liberal government has given us reason to believe that it would weaponize hate speech laws against its political opponents for political gain.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8887915">Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> would introduce a second significant change by adding a subjective, emotionally driven definition of hatred that lowers the threshold that was essentially set by the Supreme Court of Canada. As many members know, this is important because hatred is not defined in our Criminal Code. Rather, its meaning has developed over decades through case law, the most notable case being the 2013 Supreme Court case Saskatchewan v. Whatcott. That case said the term “hatred” must be interpreted as extreme manifestations of the emotion described by the words “detestation” and “vilification” and should not include representations that merely discredit, offend or insult.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887916">That objective standard set by the Supreme Court protects freedom of expression while targeting real harm. The Liberal government seeks to overturn that Supreme Court definition with Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> by replacing that decision with a new subsection 319(7), which is found in Bill C-9. In this new subsection, the Liberals wish to redefine hatred as “the emotion that involves detestation or vilification and that is stronger than disdain or dislike”. Removing the word “extreme” lowers the threshold that the Supreme Court put in place to protect free speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887917">By focusing on emotion rather than extreme manifestations, the government’s new definition shifts attention to feelings rather than actual harm. Under the Liberal Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, citizens may self-censor, and prosecutors would also gain wide discretion to pursue cases based on perceived emotion, not demonstrable harm. This creates a real risk that individuals may be penalized for strong dissent, even without intent to incite hatred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887918">Why does this matter? It is important to recognize that these harmful parts of Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> could cause real issues for freedom of speech. Removing the Attorney General's consent and watering down the definition of “hatred” directly threaten our fundamental freedom of expression, which is contained in subsection 2(b) of the charter. Once charged with hate speech, a person's life can be ruined long before a verdict, with careers lost, reputations destroyed and families fractured. Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> amounts to cancel culture that is enforced by government power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887919">Laws that protect against hatred toward Christians, Jews, Muslims or any faith group must be enforced under existing laws contained in sections 318 and 319. Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> would not create new protections; it would create a fake law. It pretends to fight hate while really concentrating power in Ottawa. By removing the Attorney General’s oversight and inserting a vague new definition of hatred, this bill would give the government a tool to harass dissenters and weaponize the law for political gain.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887920">Hate is real, and it must always be confronted, but we do not confront hate by weakening democracy. We do not confront hate by stripping away safeguards, criminalizing emotions and centralizing power in Ottawa. The true test of our democracy is not how we treat speech that we agree with, but how we protect the freedom of those with whom we profoundly disagree. Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> fails that test. It risks turning the coercive apparatus of the state into a weapon of dissent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887921">I stand here not just as a member of Parliament for the good people of Haldimand—Norfolk, nor as a lawyer, but as a Canadian and a Christian who believes that freedom of expression is sacred. We already have the laws to punish genuine hatred. We must now guard against a government that uses the language of protection as a cloak for control.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887933">Mr. Speaker, as always, it is an honour to rise in the House on behalf of the people of Oshawa. They have entrusted me to be their voice here in Ottawa.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887934">Today I rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, the government's proposed combatting hate act. Let me begin where I think we all agree: I believe that every member of the chamber rejects hate and extremism. Every member should want Canadians to feel safe in their home, in their school, in their place of worship and in their community spaces. Police and prosecutors must have the right tools to protect Canadians from real threats, but the question before us is not whether we oppose hate; the question is whether Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> would be the serious, effective law Canadians need, or whether it would be a flawed, politically motivated gesture.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887935">Canadians have lived with rising hate in recent years. Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, indigenous and Christian communities have all faced threats, vandalism, harassment and violence. It feels like the government is not really serious about combatting hate crime, as we see the bill arrive now, seemingly timed to coincide with politics. The sad reality is that it feels as if Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> is less about protecting Canadians and more about protecting Liberal political standing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887936">After the October 7 massacre in Israel, when Hamas brutally attacked innocent civilians, Jewish Canadians here at home immediately faced an unprecedented wave of anti-Semitism. Synagogues were vandalized. Students were harassed simply for attending school. Jewish communities lived in fear. The Liberals' response was that they waited, and then they introduced the bill that is before us so they could say to Jewish Canadians, "Look what we did for you.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887937">At the very same time, they moved to grant recognition to Palestine, despite the fact that Hamas still holds innocent hostages to this day and was even responsible for the deaths of multiple Canadians. That sends a troubling mixed message; it shows that the government is more interested in political symbolism than in confronting hate with urgency and clarity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887938"> My friend Paula Kelly, when she heard about the bill, sent me this; “my rant", she called it. She said, “it was done to tell minority communities, especially [mine,] the Jewish one, ‘Look what we did for you. You see, we care.’ Then an about turn, and they recognize Palestine [at the worst possible time]. They make me so angry. And how stupid do they think the Jewish community is? And may I add, laws are already in place; [we] just have to enforce said laws.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887939">Let us not ignore another reality: anti-Christian hate has been rising in Canada, yet it receives little acknowledgement from the government. Since 2021, more than 100 Christian churches have been burned or vandalized, many of them through confirmed arson. These were not just buildings; they were places of worship, community centres and anchors for families, seniors and entire congregations that have been left traumatized.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887940">When synagogues were attacked, when mosques were threatened, when gurdwaras were defaced, leaders rightly stood and denounced those crimes, but when Christian churches were burned, the silence from the federal Liberal government was deafening. If we are serious about combatting hate in all its forms, then we must call it out consistently, no matter who the target is. Hate is hate. Every faith community deserves equal recognition, equal protection and equal respect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887941">One of the most troubling aspects of Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> is how it carelessly mis-characterizes cultural and religious symbols. For millions of people around the world, a sacred symbol of peace and prosperity has been part of their faith and tradition for thousands of years, yet in the legislation, that same symbol is lumped together with hate imagery, as though it were born of extremism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887942">I want to be clear that the concerns are not just abstract legal ones. I have heard directly from communities in Oshawa and across the Durham region that are deeply troubled by how the bill mis-characterizes their sacred symbols. For them, what the government is labelling as hateful is in fact a symbol of peace, faith, and prosperity, something that has been part of their cultural and religious tradition for thousands of years.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8887943">These residents told me that they now worry that their heritage could be stigmatized or even criminalized because of vague and sloppy drafting in Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>. They feel unseen and unheard and unfairly associated with hate that has nothing to do with their faith. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887944">It is my duty to bring their voices to this chamber. If we are serious about combatting hate, then we must do it with precision and cultural understanding. Sweeping up sacred traditions in the same net as extremist symbols is not only insulting; it undermines the very fairness Canadians expect from their lawmakers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887945">Another concern is that Canada already has hate laws. The Criminal Code already prohibits advocating genocide, promoting hatred and committing hate-motivated crimes. Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> would not create new protections; it would simply make certain hate-motivated conduct a separate offence. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887946">What would that achieve? It would achieve more paperwork, more duplication and more symbolism, and perhaps even shorter sentences would be possible. Canadians do not need symbolic legislation. We need laws that are clear, enforceable and effective.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887947">The bill would also remove the requirement for the Attorney General's consent before hate propaganda prosecutions. That safeguard has long ensured that prosecutions are pursued responsibly and consistently. It has prevented frivolous or ideological complaints from overwhelming the courts. Police and prosecutors themselves recognize its value. Removing it would risk abuse and misuse, specifically in private prosecutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887948">Then, of course, there is the definition of hatred, as mentioned by many of my colleagues before me. Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> would codify the definition from the Supreme Court, but it would deliberately strip out important words. By lowering the threshold, the government would risk capturing speech that, while offensive, would remain protected in a free democracy. In a country like ours, people must be able to express views, even unpopular ones, without fear of criminal prosecution, as long as they do not cross into true hate or incitement. Again, these laws already exist. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887949">When the scope of criminal law is expanded carelessly, we risk over-criminalization and uneven enforcement. We risk focusing on political optics instead of the real threats that Canadians face from violent extremists and repeat offenders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887950">Canadians deserve better than symbolic gestures and flawed drafting. They deserve laws that confront hate directly, consistently and effectively while also defending the freedoms that define us as Canadians. We must protect synagogues, mosques, churches, gurdwaras, schools and cultural centres from threats and intimidation. We must also protect free expression, peaceful protest and civil liberties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887951">Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, as written, would not get that balance right. Our duty in this House is not to rubber-stamp legislation; it is our duty to scrutinize it and to challenge it and to demand better, so that every Canadian can live free from hate and free from fear while also being free to speak, free to believe and free to assemble. That is the balance Canadians expect us to strike. That is the balance we must deliver.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887957">Mr. Speaker, the question from our delightful colleague from Winnipeg seemed to indicate that the Liberal government, which put forward the bill, believes that there are no redundancies built into the bill and that the things they are criminalizing are not already covered by existing law. I want to ask my hon. colleague about this, because we know that intimidation is already a crime and threats are already a crime. We have several sections of the Criminal Code that would already apply to the very scenario the Liberals are claiming needs a new section. I am wondering what the member makes of that and of the fact that the Liberals do not even seem to understand the laws they are trying to amend.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887958">Mr. Speaker, I respect that question, because it is very true. Canada already criminalizes the wilful promotion of hatred under section 319, but the bill would create new offences under proposed subsection 319(2.2), so this would be a duplication. It feels like it is more about politics than public safety, but it would go a little further, and the things we are concerned about include removing the Attorney General and changing the definition of “hate”. That is a very serious thing to do. We have to look at that very closely, and we look forward to doing so.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8887980">This legislation, in my view, is flawed and redundant. We already have laws to cover what this legislation would be doing. I am going to talk about the real issue that I see, which is enforcing criminal laws in our country. It is one of the problems we have in our country right now, not the lack of laws. I also want to talk a bit about what we should be talking about, which is our Conservative plan to combat crime. There are real crimes happening in our country and real problems that everyday citizens are facing, and we need to take action. That is what we need to talk about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887981">I am not a lawyer, but frankly, anything to do with stopping hate sounds like a good thing. When I first looked at this bill, it seemed like something I would maybe be interested in supporting. However, as I started talking to people, I heard a lot of people say they were for it and a lot say they were against it. A lot of issues started coming up, and I realized that maybe a bit more needed to be looked at in this bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887982">Instead of reading about the bill, I grabbed the bill and looked at it to see what it actually said, and I found some interesting things. The first thing I noticed as I read the bill is that it would create a new intimidation offence. It would prohibit conduct intended to provoke fear in order to impede access to religious, cultural, education or community places. In other words, if there was a demonstration outside a church, mosque or synagogue and a person trying to go there felt intimidated and did not feel safe, that is what this bill is referring to. Okay, that is fine, but we already have subsection 423(1) of the Criminal Code, which is about using intimidation to stop people from doing something lawful. It is not so much that we are lacking the law to protect our religious, cultural, educational and community places, but it is that we do not tend to enforce the law that is already there. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887983">I kept reading the bill and found a second offence that it would create, a new obstruction offence, which would prohibit intentionally obstructing or interfering with lawful access to religious, cultural, education or community places. That is a whole other level of intimidation when someone cannot physically get there. Once again, we already have laws for this. There are subsections 176(2) and 176(3) in the Criminal Code, for obstructing or disturbing religious services or meetings. It is already an offence. There is also section 264, which deals with criminal harassment, threats and stalking. These are long-standing offences that have been used in many different cases, but there is often a lack of enforcement of these laws in the specific circumstances related to churches and other religious institutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887984">I found a third criminal offence that the bill would create, which is a new hate crime offence. It proposes to establish that any federal offence motivated by hatred would be a distinct offence with elevated penalties. We already have laws against hate. In fact, section 718.2 of the Criminal Code makes hate an aggravating factor when someone is convicted. In other words, if a person is convicted of assault, mischief or some more serious crime and it was motivated by hate, a judge can add hate as an aggravating factor, which would make the sentence that much longer. It would make the offence that much more serious to the person. We already have this, and again, it is just not enforced as much as it should be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887985">A fourth offence would be created by this bill, a new hate propaganda offence, which would prohibit the public display of certain hate or terrorist symbols with intent to promote hatred against an identifiable group. An unfortunate example of this happened just a week ago in St. Thomas, where a family that moved into a neighbourhood was promoting a lot of anti-Semitic material and songs and a swastika was mowed into the lawn. Guess what. Two people were arrested and charged with criminal harassment, public incitement of hatred and mischief. This just happened. We obviously have not passed this bill yet, yet the police had the laws and tools they needed to charge these two people. Fortunately, in this case, charges were laid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887986">There are of course even more laws. There is a hate propaganda law in section 318, even for things like advocating genocide. There is section 319, for public incitement likely to cause a breach of the peace. Subsection 319(2) deals with the wilful promotion of hatred, and subsection 319(2.1) is about the wilful promotion of anti-Semitism. Of course, there is section 430, which deals with mischief to property motivated by hate. That is already an indictable offence with a maximum penalty of 10 years. We have all of these laws on the books that deal with the subject matter that this particular legislation is talking about.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8887987"> I kept reading because there was more. There were a couple more things that I found. The first was that the law removes the requirement for the Attorney General to agree to lay hate charges. There are pros and cons to this. Some would say that this is a roadblock and that it makes it difficult to lay hate charges. Others would say that it also prevents vexatious charges from happening. It provides that sober second thought to make sure that this does indeed reach the bar of a hate crime. Removing the requirement for the Attorney General is maybe not the best idea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887988">The other thing that I found, the last thing, was that it removes the word “extreme” from the definition of hatred. Instead of extreme bias or hatred toward a particular group, it says bias or hatred toward that group.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887989">Again, it lowers the bar a little, making it a little easier for vexatious charges to be laid, which is concerning to me. We have to be careful that we do not give too much power to the state when it comes to maintaining our freedoms. It is a balance that we have to be really careful with. If we take all of that together, the legislation does not actually do a whole lot. In terms of the first points that I made, we already have the laws to cover what we need to do here. It is just those last two things, which are relatively small, I would say, that it changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887990">This is really window dressing. It avoids the real problem, which I have mentioned a few times, and that is proper enforcement. To be clear, I am not criticizing the police. In fact, if we were to talk to any police officers about any kind of crime in our country, they would say that they are very frustrated. They want to enforce the laws, but they have a lot of problems and a lot of things holding them back. For example, they know that criminals will just end up getting bail instead of going to jail, which makes it very difficult for them to arrest people. There is a lack of will at the civic, provincial and even federal levels among prosecutors to actually prosecute these crimes. Therefore, police are not empowered to lay these charges, because the prosecutors will simply not prosecute them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887991">Conservatives believe in protecting vulnerable communities; we also believe in free expression, religious freedom and peaceful protest. These are the things that we need to balance. My concern with the legislation is that it would tip the scales a little bit too much toward giving a lot of power to the federal government. I am concerned about free expression.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887992">We need to target hate crimes with real enforcement instead of targeting law-abiding Canadians. I want to point out that the symbol part of the legislation can be very tricky as well. Symbols are used in many different situations. Of course, there is the example with the Hindu community, which has used what we would call the swastika for eons as one of its sacred symbols. It has very positive meanings for them, but the Nazis took that symbol over and called it the <I>hakenkreuz</I>, and that became their symbol of Nazism. Therefore, we have to be very careful not to outlaw a symbol that is very meaningful to certain groups. We have to be very careful. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887993">Briefly, I want to speak about what the government should be focusing on, in my opinion. This corresponds to what we believe as Conservatives, which is that we should be focusing on the real crime issues that we have in our country. We should be helping our Canadian residents to feel safe in their own neighbourhoods, but they do not feel safe right now. We should be helping police forces, prosecutors and courts to do their jobs. We should be helping them to get things done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887994">We have a lack of timely follow-through. Charges get dropped. There are weak sentences. This comes back to some of the legislative changes that the Liberal government has made. Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> were reforms that it undertook to eliminate a lot of mandatory minimum sentences, to reduce the sentencing times, to actually create house arrest, to allow criminals to get out on bail rather than going to jail. These are the things that are causing the problems in our cities and our country today. These are the issues that my constituents, and I think all of our constituents, talk about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887995">These are the issues that we should be debating and changing in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887996">Where is the Liberal bill to undo the bail reforms that Liberals made, to get criminals back in jail rather than out on bail? We are still waiting. We have been promised this for months, and it has not happened. Everybody is asking for this. Mayors are asking for this. Provincial premiers are asking for this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8887997">We really need to move forward. I want to reiterate that I believe Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> is flawed. We need to focus on what we need to do to fix the problems that we have with our laws in our country so that Canadians can feel safe in their neighbourhoods, so that Canadians can have peace and so that they can live in harmony and practise freedom.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8888011">Mr. Speaker, first, as a preamble that really should go without saying, there is no disagreement in any corner of the House about the values that should underlie this legislation. We all value a safe Canada where every single human is free to live their lives as their fullest selves irrespective of their race, religion, ethnicity, language, physical or mental disability, etc. There is no member in this House who wants to see hate or the symbols of hate that the present legislation deals with displayed or promoted in any way in our country or in any other country. I think we remain unanimous in the House in condemning hate, hate crimes and hate propaganda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888012">However, a careful distinction must be brought to bear between condemnation and criminalization, and we must always note this. When we approach discussions of criminalization, it should be with humility. If I could wave a magic wand and stop anyone in this country from ever propagating any hate or committing a hate crime, I swear I would do it, but such magic is not one of the powers vested in us as elected representatives. We can only modify the criminal justice system, and we must be alive to the unintended consequences that such modifications could have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888013">In that spirit, I would honestly like to raise with the members opposite the following concerns I have with this legislation. Number one, would it drive hate organizations underground? It is said that sunlight is the best disinfectant. When the <Affiliation DbId="318625" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> introduced this legislation, my thoughts immediately turned to the famous and thankfully aborted Nazi rally in Skokie, Illinois, of 1977. It is a very famous case, in part because the ACLU lawyer who fought for the right of those marchers to march was David Goldberger, who was a very proud Jew. Reprehensibly, the marchers chose Skokie, Illinois, because there was a high proportion of Holocaust survivors there whom they sought to terrify. On the date of the march, 20 broken and twisted individuals wearing Nazi <I>hakenkreuzes</I> were met by 2,000 counterprotesters shouting them down. No violence occurred, and the cowardly traitorous Nazis went home without marching.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888014">A recent ABC News article quotes the current mayor of Skokie, Illinois, saying that looking back 40 years later, many positive things came out of that day. Previously, the Holocaust survivors in Skokie, he says, “were a very quiet group” who did not talk about their experiences, but he said these events “ignited a passion in them”, and they founded the Illinois Holocaust Museum &amp; Education Center within two years of that day. The ABC News article notes that both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have recognized the incredible work that museum does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888015">In many ways, John Stuart Mill can be thought of as the founder of the Liberal tradition that gives the Liberal Party its name. This is what he had to say about false and hateful opinions: “though the silenced opinion be an error...it is only by the collision of adverse opinions that the remainder of the truth has any chance of being supplied.” That is to say that no one wants to hear from hateful miscreants. No one in this House does, but when we do, we must take it as a solemn opportunity to perhaps not change their minds, but loudly and with facts and arguments disabuse whatever listeners they may have of the poison they utter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888016">With the words of John Stuart Mill and the examples of the Skokie counterprotesters in mind, I ask the <Affiliation DbId="318625" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> this admittedly counterintuitive question: By driving hate into the fetid swamps of Discord or whatever website has replaced 4chan, does it deprive our communities the opportunity to denounce it in person and to show people in the real world that their views are not welcome and that their movement has no purchase among the 99.9% of Canadians who value each other's fundamental rights and freedoms? As a sub-concern, if it is allowed to fester in these dark corners of the Internet, when it does finally burst out, is it more likely to do so in a form worse than a flag or symbol? I do not ask this question lightly, and it brings me to my second concern with the proposed legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888017">In some comments I made following a speech about criminal justice, I expressed concern that the deputy government House leader seemed more concerned with abstractions rather than concrete occurrences. On this side of the House, we pride ourselves on our concern for concrete occurrences. As a Canadian, I am terribly upset, disgusted and disappointed that Jewish individuals have been harmed by criminal psychopaths because of who they are. A man was beaten up in front of his children in Montreal this summer. A few weeks ago, a woman was stabbed in the kosher food section of a local Ottawa grocery store. Less well known is that in the spring of 2024, a 15-year-old Israeli immigrant to Canada was attacked at school for her place of origin. In that case, I believe it took two weeks before the police even deigned to lay charges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888018">In my own circle of physician friends, I am sorry and ashamed to report that some Jews have left Canada permanently because of the lack of safety these concrete events demonstrate. I want dearly for my Jewish friends to feel safe to return to Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8888019">Year after year, we have increases in violent crime in Canada. We have seen ongoing increases in every classification and every sort of violent crime. These increases, I am sorry to say, started in 2015. In every class of violent crime, we have seen a failure of the Liberal government to keep the bad guys in jail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888020">It is my understanding that the wilful promotion of hatred, whether with a symbol or a flag or a speech or a newspaper article, is already illegal in Canada under subsection 319(2) of the Criminal Code. It is furthermore my understanding that intimidating a person who seeks to enter a place of worship or any other place is already illegal under section 423 of the Criminal Code. However, we have seen very many infractions of these already-existing laws in the targeting of religious minorities. I may go so far as to say that every religious minority is dealing with more infractions of these laws in just about every Canadian city. In fact, every Canadian is dealing with more of every sort of crime. This is why I fear that the present bill is an abstraction and a distraction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888021"> We need concrete measures. We need the violent and hateful people who do these sorts of things, who break our laws, to go to jail and stay in jail. Conservatives have proposed such measures to put the bad guys in jail. I earnestly beg the members opposite to take us up on it. Let us do these concrete things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888022">Those are my twin concerns. By removing the consent of the Attorney General and watering down the definition of hate, would the Liberals cast a wider net, driving cranks and loons underground, where they might become more hateful and, God forbid, more violent? Why would they cast a wider net when they are already refusing to use the smaller, more targeted net that they have? Why do they refuse to repeal their irresponsible bail laws that let violent psychos back on our streets again and again? I ask the questions in good faith.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8888047">Mr. Speaker, what a pleasure it is to have my son joining me here in Ottawa today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888048">This country is experiencing a serious unemployment crisis. The overall unemployment rate of 7.1% is bad enough, but it is young Canadians who are suffering the most, with a disastrous rate of 15.5%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888049">It is not just the number of unemployed people that is a problem, but also how long they remain unemployed. On average, people stay unemployed for more than 21 weeks. This means that more Canadians, especially young people, are out of work and staying out of work longer. They wait, they struggle, and many lose hope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888050">I have spoken with Canadians who are experiencing this. A young programmer living in Vancouver told me that he had sent out over 1,000 job applications. He is educated, skilled and ready to contribute. However, after more than a year, he is still unemployed. This is the reality for far too many people. That young man is not alone. I hear the same story in Toronto, Quebec City, Montreal, small towns and rural areas. Young Canadians everywhere say they want to work, but they cannot find a job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888051">Why is this happening? It is because the government has made choices that hurt Canadian workers. It has allowed certain immigration programs, such as the temporary foreign worker program, to be abused while genuine asylum seekers wait years for a decision. We even see fake college acceptance letters being used to circumvent the system. Meanwhile, Canadians who are here and ready to work cannot find jobs. Is this fair? No. Is it responsible? Certainly not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888052">The government is also blocking projects that would create jobs. Bill <Document DbId="13050012" Type="3">C‑69</Document> and other measures have blocked investments in natural resources, pipelines and mines. These projects would have provided work for thousands of families, but instead of freeing up Canadian talent, this government is tying it up with red tape and gatekeepers. While other countries are moving forward, Canada is moving backward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888053"> The result is clear. TD Bank predicts that 100,000 jobs could be lost by the third quarter this year. The Governor of the Bank of Canada says that businesses are going to scale back hiring. The numbers are there, but behind every number is a family, a young graduate and a community losing hope. This government's record is clear: More Canadians are staying out of work for longer and with fewer opportunities for the future. We have talent, energy and resources, but instead of unleashing that potential, the government is putting up roadblocks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888054">My question is simple, and I will ask it directly: When will the government finally remove the roadblocks, listen to Canadians and let our workers, especially our young people, build their future here at home in Canada?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8888056">The world of work is rapidly changing, so we are committed to protecting and supporting workers in this time of labour market uncertainty. We are transitioning to a one economy agenda. We are making significant investments to ensure Canadians have the skills they need to fill in-demand jobs. We are advancing new opportunities, especially for our youth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888057">It is estimated that one in six Canadians have careers in the skilled trades, and registrations for new apprenticeships are higher than they have been in over a decade. However, there is a massive retirement wave sweeping across the country, so we need to encourage more young Canadians to pursue this line of work because this retirement wave is leaving a critical shortage of skilled trade workers in its wake. In fact, we are predicting that 600,000 skilled trade workers will retire by 2031.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8888058">Creating and promoting these employment opportunities is a key priority for the Canadian government. Skilled trades offer respected, well-paid, highly sought-after and rewarding jobs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888059">Budget 2024 laid out a forward-looking plan to build nearly 3.9 million new homes by 2031. To achieve that, we need more Red Seal certified tradespeople, including carpenters, plumbers and electricians. That is why the Government of Canada is investing nearly $1 billion annually in apprenticeship support.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888060">It is fair to say that many young Canadians have seen their wages decline, and it is difficult for them to take advantage of new training opportunities when they are struggling to make ends meet. That is why we are taking steps to make apprenticeships more affordable, for instance by offering loans, tax credits and employment insurance benefits. Apprentices can access EI benefits while attending technical training and obtain an interest-free Canada apprentice loan of up to $20,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888061">Furthermore, through the Canadian sustainable jobs act, we are ensuring that Canadians have access to sustainable, well-paid jobs that contribute to their prosperity.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8888062">I would also mention that our future skills centre has helped more than 105,000 Canadians access the skills training or employment they need for a successful future. We are prioritizing workforce initiatives and opportunities such as these, which will develop a larger, highly certified, diverse and inclusive trades workforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888063">We are making sure that those who face additional barriers have access to the supports needed to access education and training and get a job. This includes indigenous youth, new immigrants, young people living in poverty or facing homelessness, youth who identify as 2SLGBTQIA+, young persons with disabilities, Black and racialized youth, and young women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888064">Labour market participation among working-age mothers with young children was up to 79.1% in 2024 from 75.8% in 2019. This is a promising statistic, but there is a lot more work that needs to be done across all sectors, and we will be there with the provinces and territories to make sure that we have the fastest-growing economy in the G7.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8888071">Mr. Speaker, I should probably say, on behalf of Canadian firearms owners and on behalf of the Conservatives, how grateful I am to the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> for telling the truth about the Liberal government's sham of a buyback. Unfortunately he has not been so candid in the House of Commons when he knows the cameras and the microphones are rolling, but when he was speaking with a constituent, a tenant, an ordinary Canadian raising very legitimate concerns, he said that it is a waste of time. It is a waste of money. It is not going to go after the causes of gun crime in this country, which has run rampant after 10 years of Liberal government and mismanagement of the justice file. Of course, when he is called on this in the House of Commons, he retreats back to the Liberal talking points that I am sure his <Affiliation DbId="319425" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> will give us this evening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888072">. I want to ask a very fundamental question about the buyback, because we know that the order in council prohibited what was at first over 1,500 models of firearms, many of them used quite regularly and quite routinely for hunting, some of them obsolete and non-existent in the Canadian market. The order in council, which launched the prohibition that has justified the so-called buyback, came after a tragedy in Canada, a killing spree in Portapique, Nova Scotia, to which every sensible, reasonable person in this country would respond with disgust and horror.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888073">The problem is that it was not a spree that involved legally owned firearms. It was not a spree that would have been prevented by the very measures the Liberal government introduced in the days that followed. The reason I bring this up is that the last time I spoke to the <Affiliation DbId="319425" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> about firearms, he invoked that tragedy to justify the Liberal government's gun confiscation scheme, a scheme that by its very design targets only law-abiding gun owners, because the criminals in this country are not the ones who will be lining up to turn over their illegal firearms to the government, regardless of whether there is any compensation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888074">What we have here is something the government says will cost three-quarters of a billion dollars. By the way, with Liberal math, I believe we need to triple it and add 50% or something to get somewhere close to the real number. Even if we take at face value that it will cost three-quarters of a billion dollars, that is money that could be going towards beefing up law enforcement. It is money that could be going towards beefing up the border to cause us to be better able to intercept illegal firearms coming from the U.S., the firearms that genuinely end up in violent street crime in Toronto, Surrey and other communities across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888075">There were police experts before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights last week, who were very candid, as candid as the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> is when he does not know he is being recorded. They said there will be not minimal but zero effect on gun crime when the gun confiscation scheme goes forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888076">I asked the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> why he has not fired the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation>, who does not even know what a firearms licence is, does not even know what the Canadian firearms safety course is and does not know the classifications of firearms but thinks he somehow has the credibility to tell Canadian gun owners who are vetted and trained that they should turn over their property to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888077">Therefore I ask the government, when will it drop the pretense, drop the facade, get rid of this sham of a buyback and go after real criminals, not law-abiding hunters and sport shooters?</ParaText>

The safety of Canadians is the number one priority for this government and we are taking decisive action to stop the increase in gun violence at our borders and in our communities across Canada. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8888079">The Ruger Mini-14 used by Marc Lépine at École Polytechnique, the Beretta CX4 Storm used at Dawson College by Kimveer Gill and the CZ858 used by Richard Henry Bain at the Metropolis nightclub are assault-style weapons that have marked Canadian history.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8888080"> The government feels that the significant risk posed by these assault-style firearms in no way justifies keeping them in Canadian communities. Since 2020, it has banned approximately 2,500 makes and models of firearms. These are firearms that are not suitable for hunting or sport and that exceed safe civilian use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888081">Getting these guns off our streets is in line with the recommendations of the mass casualty commission, which advocates banning assault weapons and rapidly reducing the number of weapons in circulation. These weapons can no longer be used. It only makes sense that our government would want to fairly compensate people who owned these weapons. I would also like to point out that 19,000 other models of firearms will remain available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888082"> As of April 30, under the assault-style firearms compensation program, more than 12,000 prohibited firearms had been collected from businesses and then destroyed. Now, our government has announced that it is moving forward with the program for individual owners. We are starting with a pilot project in Cape Breton. The program will then open to all eligible owners across the country with a declaration period in the fall of 2025, followed by a collection and compensation period in early 2026.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888083">However, no single program can stop gun violence on its own. That is why the compensation program is being rolled out alongside several other measures. The government's comprehensive plan to combat gun crime includes funding to build safe communities and to help stop gun and gang violence. It also includes strengthening our borders, where we have committed to adding resources to combat firearms trafficking and smuggling to prevent them from entering Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888084">Since 2016, our government has invested more than $1.4 billion in targeted initiatives. This includes more than $560 million to equip the RCMP and the CBSA with state-of-the-art tools to detect smuggled firearms, including the type of firearms used in the Portapique shooting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888085">Last summer, our government announced that detectors, drones and helicopters would be deployed at the border, along with additional staff and canine units. This will greatly increase law enforcement's ability to detect and seize firearms and prohibited weapons. Together, our efforts are preventing firearms from being diverted to the black market, where they would be misused to commit crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888086">Through these initiatives, our government is taking meaningful steps to make Canada less vulnerable to gun violence while being fair to responsible, law-abiding owners and businesses.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8888087">Mr. Speaker, we can go through the list, although not in the time we have tonight, and look at all the models that have been prohibited by the government and are used by hunters or, in some cases, by hobbyists. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888088">I will mention one firearm in particular. I do not know if the word translates well into French, but it is called the Plinkster. “Plinking” refers to shooting tin cans as a hobby. A model of the Plinkster, a .22-calibre rifle, has been put on the Liberal government's prohibition list. It has never been used in a shooting in Canada, mass or otherwise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888089">I will ask the public safety minister's parliamentary secretary a simple question: Should the owner of a Plinkster who does not sell his firearm to the government be arrested and jailed?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8888090">Mr. Speaker, all the weapons that have been declared prohibited were selected by a committee of experts, by people who know about firearms. We are not talking about members of Parliament here, but experts who know about firearms. These weapons meet all the criteria for military-style assault firearms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888091">I want to reaffirm our government's commitment to upholding public safety through strict gun control. We are determined to get assault weapons off our streets, limit the devastating effects of gun violence and help make Canada safer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888092">Assault weapons have no place on our streets. The compensation program for individual owners was recently launched in Cape Breton and will open to the rest of the country in the fall. It will move forward, which is what most Canadians want.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8888093">Mr. Speaker, it is October 1, 2025. The government's fiscal year is April 1 to March 31 every year. We are now seven months behind in having a budget presented to this House of Commons on how the government is going to choose what it is spending money on this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888094">Budgets are important documents. I was in a synagogue in Calgary some time ago, and the rabbi and I had a discussion about the importance of budgets in religious organizations and also in governments. They are important documents because they represent choices. They represent priorities and they represent respect for other people's money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888095">This budget is not showing any of those. There has been no priority listed for seven months now into this fiscal year. Nobody knows what the government's priorities and choices are going to be. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888096">Furthermore, this shows a complete disregard for other people's money. That is the money of the taxpayers of Canada, who are not getting a view of where the government is going to spend the money that they trust it with to run the services that are provided to Canadians. That is a problem. If the public does not have its eyes on exactly what the government is doing and exactly how it is going to measure its performance, then we are missing one of the key attributes of a democratic society that has an accountable and responsible government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888097">One of the roles of the House of Commons is to approve not just the budget but the actual spending that goes out. It is called the estimates process. This past year, the House was prorogued for much of the year. In the last year, we sat in this House as a Parliament for less than five months. That is a diminution of the role that democracy plays in Canada. The House was prorogued for almost four months. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888098">We had an election. In the meantime, billions of dollars were issued through what we call government awards. They were not approved by Parliament. There was no vetting of what was going on here. There was just money going out the door through the last fiscal year and into this fiscal year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888099">Now we are into a budget process in which we are effectively seven months behind. This is as a result of complete incompetence and a disregard for the tools of democracy that are time-tested in Canada about what we are supposed to do, how we are supposed to perform and how we are supposed to report that to Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888100">There is a consequence to this. One of the main problems with running budget deficits is it creates inflation, particularly when the budget deficits are financed by a central bank that is printing money. That causes inflation. There is no question about that. The thing about inflation, to define what it is for people, is that it reduces their buying power for what they can purchase in society. That is the problem. It means that our rent or food costs more in real dollars. It is a tax. It means less disposable income for Canadians. It means they have to play catch-up every year. The government can inflate the dollars it is collecting and try to debase the dollars it is actually spending. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888101">However, it is about choices at the end of the day. This year, what is the deficit going to be? We do not know. It was going to be $50 billion, then $60 billion. In the spring, I thought it would be $80 billion. Then the C. D. Howe Institute came out and said it was going to be $92 billion, yet the government continues its spending. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888102">The solution, according to the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, is to restate the way we report this budget. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888103">This is not a solution. We have to get back to balanced budgets.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8888104"> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Calgary Centre for his question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888105"> Our government is working to implement a clear and ambitious plan to build a strong, united and resilient economy that serves Canadian businesses, workers and families. The <Affiliation DbId="318631" Type="4">Minister of Finance and National Revenue</Affiliation> has already announced that he will present budget 2025 on November 4.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888106">We are faced with a series of historic challenges, from unjust U.S. tariffs to constantly evolving global trade standards, on top of affordability and housing concerns. Budget 2025 will seize these generational opportunities to transform our economy. It will do this through ambitious investments, increased fiscal restraint and responsible management, ensuring that every dollar is spent wisely to build the strongest economy in the G7. This budget will invest heavily in housing and infrastructure. It will spur major private investment and establish new strategic agreements with trusted partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888107"> At the same time, our government is introducing a new fiscal discipline in its day-to-day operations, ensuring more efficient and reliable public services. This discipline allows us to focus resources where they matter most: on sustainable growth that will ensure Canada's prosperity today and for generations to come, from coast to coast to coast, including, I would like to point out, in La Prairie—Atateken.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888108">We are also redoubling our efforts to make housing more affordable. Thanks to the GST relief on new homes valued up to $1 million, first-time homebuyers will be able to save up to $50,000. For new homes valued between $1 million and $1.5 million, a partial GST reduction will also apply to support more Canadian families hoping to become homeowners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888109">Through this same legislation, we eliminated the consumer carbon tax, refocusing carbon pricing on large emitters. To cite another example, the recent launch of the Build Canada Homes program will accelerate the construction of new housing to further reduce housing costs by increasing supply. We are not only transforming Canada's housing sector, we are streamlining federal approval processes to accelerate the construction of major projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888110">We are doing all of this because Canadians have given us a clear mandate: to take bold action to stimulate economic growth, create well-paying jobs and ensure that all Canadians fully benefit from the exceptional talent and ingenuity that our country is known for, whether it be our strong free trade agreements, our collective wealth or our unique prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888111">When faced with a choice between one of the world's top economists and a career politician who has never worked a day in the private sector, Canadians spoke loud and clear. Unlike the party opposite, we heard them, and in the global context of constant change, our government can reduce costs, reinforce stability and deliver greater security and prosperity for all Canadians precisely by carrying out this mandate.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8888112">Mr. Speaker, I have spoken about the importance of budgets in the democratic process and in the Canadian context as well. I did not hear any response to that at all from the government side.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888113"> The issue, of course, is that these are time-tested democratic instruments that we have. We are the institution, the House of Commons, that authorize this, but Canadians have to have their eyes on what their government is spending on and why the deficits are getting so large, because it has already become a large problem, and it is going to become a bigger problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888114">Let us accept that we have a government that is now run by a central banker, and central bankers have a penchant for solving the problem by printing money. Printing money is going to cause inflation, and we know this. It is time-tested and known around the world. Inflation is going to cause heartbreak and heartache in so many sectors of our economy. This is the big issue here. Will the government please get ahead of the deficit issue, because it is going to cause significant financial pain for all Canadians?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8888118">Budget 2025 will highlight the new fiscal discipline guiding our actions: Spend less so the country can invest more.
