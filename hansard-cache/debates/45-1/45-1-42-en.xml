Since 2023, under the watch of the Liberal government, the family reunification pathway for Ukrainians has seen an abysmal approval rate of just 1.6%. Fewer than 400 of the more than 23,000 applications have received final decisions. Thousands more cannot even access this limited program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936276">While Ukrainian Canadians are calling on the government to create a dedicated, one-time permanent residency pathway for those here under the CUAET agreement, the undersigned are urging the Liberal government to prioritize and expedite family reunification applications so that families can be reunited without further delay.</ParaText>

More than 30,000 charities fall under the purpose “advancement of religion”, roughly 42% of the charitable sector. These religious communities foster vibrant social networks, mobilize outreach, spark local volunteerism and foster community resilience.</ParaText>

Regrettably, while I am the third NDP member to have an opportunity to rise in the House, it is because the Liberals do not rise to talk about their own piece of legislation because they do not want to talk about it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936286">This is good for us because it gives me an opportunity to be able to talk about it on behalf of the constituents of Rosemont—La Petite‑Patrie as well as several representatives of civil society organizations who are very concerned about the impacts of this piece of legislation on asylum seekers and refugees. I will be discussing this during my speech, but first allow me to provide some background.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936287">Yesterday, the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gave an important pre-budget speech at the University of Ottawa. What we saw was a Liberal Prime Minister who, in Canada, takes a very strong Canadian nationalist, protectionist, elbows up line. He talks about defending our sovereignty, our jobs and our companies. However, when the Prime Minister is in the Oval Office in Washington, he completely changes tack. He no longer demonstrates the same strength, the same character, the same determination. He seems to be kowtowing, pandering. The Prime Minister seems to be doing everything he can to appease U.S. President Donald Trump. He is doing everything he can to make him happy. As we have seen on several occasions, despite the Prime Minister's tough talk when in Canada, nothing ever happens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936288">The current Prime Minister was elected largely because of his platform to stand against U.S. President Donald Trump. Instead, he keeps backing down and making overtures to please the American president. Why is the Prime Minister suddenly trying to revive the Keystone XL pipeline? After promising to make web giants, GAFAM, pay their fair share, why is the Prime Minister now backtracking just because the American president does not really like the idea of taxes being imposed on these big corporations that are making billions of dollars in profits at Canadians' expense? The Prime Minister is not standing up. He does not have his elbows up, ready to lead the fight. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936289">What we are seeing today with Bill C‑12, which is a new incarnation of Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C‑2</Document>, is the same backpedalling and the same attempt to pander to Donald Trump's administration. That man obsesses over certain things. He is anti-migrant, anti-refugee and anti-asylum seeker, plus he is concerned about borders. He is also concerned about drug trafficking, which is entirely legitimate. Opioids and fentanyl are having devastating effects on our communities, and serious measures must be put in place at the border, particularly when it comes to the Canada Border Services Agency. However, the government is playing along with Donald Trump's game, attempting to give him guarantees so that he might eventually negotiate with us. After six months, all we are seeing is setbacks that hurt Quebeckers and Canadians and, in this case, will hurt thousands of people whose fundamental rights will be violated by the Liberal government in an attempt to pander to the American president.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936290">There are people in this field who work for more than 300 civil society organizations and who have already spoken out against the Liberal government's Bill C‑12. I am going to quote them, and I am going to use their line of reasoning to discuss them today, because I think it is important. These are people active on the ground, who know the reality of the situation. They know exactly how this will impact the lives of certain people, including parents, families and children. In some cases, these consequences are very severe.</ParaText>

The government refuses to listen to any new information. Too bad if someone arrived three years ago for the first time. Starting June 24, 2020, the one-year deadline starts at that point. It is absurd.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8936311">Madam Speaker, I understand that the New Democrats are having difficulty with the legislation, but I think we need to recognize that the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Liberal Party have made a commitment to Canadians to strengthen our borders, and the legislation is a very important aspect. They also made a commitment to stabilize immigration-related issues, and asylum is one of those issues. There is a holistic approach. We are also looking at budgetary measures to support it: for example, the 1,000 RCMP officers and, from my perspective, more importantly, the 1,000 Canada border control agents.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8936313">Madam Speaker, obviously, the CBSA experienced major staffing cuts under Stephen Harper's government. However, the Liberals have done nothing to remedy that situation over the past 10 years. Giving border officers back their powers and resources would help in the fight against auto theft and against the trafficking of fentanyl, drugs and illegal weapons. That is a good thing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936314">That said, why did it take the Liberal government 10 years to do something about this? The NDP wants to know. The other question I have today is this: Why does the Liberal plan involve attacking refugees and asylum seekers by violating their fundamental rights and taking away the recourse they may be entitled to?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8936316">I found it quite funny to hear him criticizing the speech given by the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> yesterday. From what I saw, the Prime Minister said nothing. Therefore, I do not have much to criticize, except the fact that he said nothing. Now back to the matter at hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936317">We are obviously all concerned about the rights of people who apply for asylum and whose lives are threatened. However, we need to recognize that there were problems at the border. These include the fact that at one point, there were human smuggling networks, which are probably still operating. They would cross at Roxham Road and demand exorbitant sums from poor and vulnerable people. We feel that strengthening border security is important. Of course, it needs to be done right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936318">At this second reading stage, does my colleague not think that we should vote in favour of the bill and send it to committee to make the necessary adjustments and take the necessary precautions so that individual rights are respected?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8936320">However, what I am saying, and what the NDP is saying, is that we must do it in a way that will not affect the remedies and procedures that protect these people's rights. As it stands now, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C‑12</Document> is fundamentally flawed. There are 300 organizations that are calling on us to vote against the bill, because it would allow the executive branch to suspend the processing of certain immigration applications. This does nothing to crack down on smugglers. All it does is penalize people who are trying to come here. The executive branch will be able to cancel visas, work permits or PR documents whenever it feels this is in the public interest. However, there is no definition of what constitutes the public interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936321">These are arbitrary powers that the Liberals want to give themselves so that they can tell U.S. President Donald Trump that they are strong and serious and that they too are capable of turning people away at the border or deporting them en masse.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8936327">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise this morning to speak to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, an act respecting certain measures relating to the security of Canada's borders and the integrity of the Canadian immigration system and respecting other related security measures. The measures in this bill were first introduced in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, an act respecting certain measures relating to the security of the border between Canada and the United States and respecting other related security measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936328"> I mention this because Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> was tabled in the House and briefly debated last June; however, it was loudly criticized by civil liberty groups and privacy groups. It included a number of provisions that were concerning not only to our Conservative caucus but to many Canadians as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936329">There were provisions that would have allowed Canada Post to open any mail, including letters, without a warrant. It would have allowed the government to ban cash payments and donations over $10,000 and would have allow warrantless access to personal information. It would have allowed the government to compel electronic service providers to re-engineer their platforms to help CSIS and the police access Canadians' private information, and it would have allowed the government to supply financial institutions with personal information if that information were useful for identifying money laundering and terrorist financing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936330">These provisions were the reason Conservatives opposed the Liberals' attempt at gaining sweeping powers and warrantless access that would violate Canadians' civil liberties. Let us be clear: The Liberals' solution to the problems they created over the last 10 years was to grant them more powers. When the Privacy Commissioner was questioned, he confirmed that the Liberals did not even consult him when trying to grant themselves sweeping new powers to access Canadians' personal information from service providers like banks and telecom companies without a warrant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936331">The good news is that Conservatives have forced the Liberals to back down from Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, which clearly would have violated Canadians' individual freedoms and privacy. Conservatives believe that law-abiding Canadians should not lose their liberty to pay for the failures of the Liberals with respect to borders and immigration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936332">That brings us to the debate today. The Liberals introduced Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, which took out many of the parts of Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> that Conservatives fought to have removed. The parts of the bill that remain, which we are discussing today, would begin to take steps on addressing the many issues that have seen nothing but inaction from the government over the past 10 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936333">Although there are provisions for the CBSA laid out, let us talk about the very real challenge the CBSA is facing that the Liberals are not addressing with the bill. The government promised to hire 1,000 new CBSA personnel, though according to the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation>, it is not his job to hire them, which would explain why the Liberals have waited 10 years to take measures on border security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936334">Ninety-nine per cent of all shipping containers are not currently scanned to see what is inside. Where is the plan to purchase and deploy the tools to crack down on the amount of smuggling that is happening through our ports?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936335">Our brave men and women who work at the CBSA protect the front line of our nation's defence. They deserve real, meaningful action from the government to help them and to equip them with the tools they need to help keep Canadians safe. They need action from the government. Conservatives believe in the important work they do, and we will continue to offer solutions and clearly defined measures to assist them in doing the work of keeping our border secure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936336">Another part of the bill seeks to address fentanyl precursor chemicals that are being used to manufacture fentanyl here in Canada. Though we welcome any efforts to crack down on the drug epidemic facing our communities, it seems the Liberals are more content with simply blaming the chemicals, and not the criminals who manufacture and distribute deadly fentanyl on our streets.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8936337">Of all apparent opioid toxicity deaths from January to June 2024, 79% involved fentanyl. The number of emergency room visits for opioid-related poisonings has more than doubled since 2018. Just two milligrams of fentanyl is enough to be a lethal dose and take someone's life. Dealing fentanyl should be punished the same as murder is, because it is effectively murder. If a fentanyl kingpin trafficks just 40 milligrams, that is enough to kill 20 people. There need to be serious deterrents, not simply banning the ingredients that make the illegal drug that people are selling to vulnerable Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936338">The Liberals continue to push for what they call safe consumption sites near schools. At the health committee, the Conservative member for <Affiliation DbId="317739" Type="2">Riding Mountain</Affiliation> and shadow minister for health called on the Liberals to shut down fentanyl consumption sites next to children. However, the Liberal minister refused to rule out approving more consumption sites next to schools and day cares, despite acknowledging that the sites are repositories for rampant fentanyl usage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936339"> The bill does not meaningfully look to defend the victims of the fentanyl crisis either. Since the Liberals took office, all violent crime is up 50% from 2015 to 2023. More money laundering and organized crime have found a home in Canada. The solution the leaders proposed in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> was to give themselves sweeping powers to spy on individual Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936340">Violent crime is up. Organized crime is up. Drug trafficking is up. Even if someone is caught by the Liberal justice system, house arrest is still permissible for some of the most serious offences. While the current government has allowed violent crime to rise all across this country, it allows violent offenders out on bail or house arrest so they can return to the very community they are a danger to. For years, Conservatives have been proposing measures to crack down on criminals and to put the charter rights of victims ahead of their abusers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936341">Part 11 of the bill would amend the Sex Offender Information Registration Act and the Customs Act, which would allow for greater accuracy in reporting, tracking and investigating sex offenders. These are welcome changes that the Conservatives have been advocating for years, and they are long overdue. However, the consistent theme the Liberals have presented to Canadians throughout both Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> and now Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is that they are not willing to be held responsible for the last 10 years they have been in government. We hear it often.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936342">While the Liberals would have Canadians believe that they are a new government, just now learning of these problems, they are not. They have been in power for 10 years and are responsible for this mess. Giving them more power to fix it is not the answer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936343"> One thing is very clear: Only Conservatives will continue to stand up for Canadians' individual freedoms and privacy. Only Conservatives will continue to advocate on behalf of Canadians. We will examine the bill thoroughly to ensure that the Liberals do not try to sneak in measures that would breach law-abiding Canadians' privacy rights.</ParaText>

It talks about human trafficking, and that is what I will be mostly talking about today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936358"> Combatting human trafficking is mentioned five times in the departmental plans. For those opposite, departmental plans are the plans submitted by the government to justify the spending for the money it asked for. It lays out the priorities for the government for the following year. It is not a legal document, but it is a document that supports the request for spending.

              <ParaText id="8936359">We have an issue with human trafficking in Edmonton, in Alberta and across the country in the construction world. We have illegal labourers being brought in and hired to work on federally funded government projects. A year ago, I presented evidence to the head of the Treasury Board about this practice. I told them that I would not make it political, and I would not publicize it, but I was providing the information so they could act on it. A year later, nothing has happened. Just last week, CBSA raided the LRT construction site in Edmonton, which is partially funded by the federal government.

              <ParaText id="8936360">The reason I bring this up, and I will refer to the failed Liberal former minister for infrastructure and the environment, Catherine McKenna, who basically said that, if one lied loud enough in the House of Commons, people will totally believe it.

Again, I delivered documents to the government about illegal labourers and human trafficking on federally funded projects. I offered to work with the Liberals, but nothing was done. Fast-forward a year, and just last week, we decided enough was enough. We tabled a motion in the operations committee to study this issue. Can members guess what happened? The Liberals shut it down and blocked the study on human trafficking on government-funded labour sites. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936361">I want to thank my good friend Rob, who is with Building Trades of Alberta, for championing this issue and bringing it to light. It has fought against this for years, because it is a double-edged sword, a double-sided problem. We have people being abused with human trafficking, and on the other side, we have Canadians, journeymen, ticketed trained union members, who cannot get work on government-funded projects because they are being undercut by workers who were trafficked, brought into Canada illegally, and employed illegally on these projects. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936362">Rob and Building Trades of Alberta, as well as other trade unions, have done yeoman's work. I actually attended a site with them on the Henday, the ring road around Edmonton. We interviewed workers and, miraculously, every single worker we spoke to was a subcontractor to the main contractor who won the bid from the government. Every single worker, Latin American, was a subcontractor. They had no employees of their own, but miraculously, every single one of them just happened to have their own company, working independently and, of course, working for cash under the table. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936363">Legitimate companies cannot win bids on these government projects. Unionized companies are getting outbid because these other construction companies will bid and then subcontract out the entire job to shadowy construction companies that fill the entire job with illegal labour. They pay cash, sometimes $10 an hour. These workers have no protection. They are not eligible for workers' compensation because they are being paid under the table. They are not eligible for unemployment insurance because they are not paying into the system. However, legitimate companies and legitimate trades people are getting shut out. It is getting to a point, as I said, where legitimate companies do not even bother bidding on government projects any more. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8936364">Here are some of the things that are happening. General contractors and major government-funded infrastructure projects are using multiple subcontractors to conceal that many of the workers are being paid cash under the table. These are contract carpenters, labourers, cement masons and other undocumented workers. They may be brought in from Facebook sites, so they will come in with visitor's visas or family visas, overstayed student visas, overstayed tourist visas or expired TFWs. They could also be on EI and working on the side. Again, there is no protection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936365">Anyone who has ever worked in construction, which I did as a youth, building houses, knows it is dangerous work. Injuries happen. One thing I have to say about the union movement across Canada for trades, and especially in the oil sands, is that it puts safety first. That is not happening at these work sites. There are workers without fall netting, without helmets, without proper PPE. I have provided documented evidence to the Treasury Board that companies are also faking journeyman papers and faking workers compensation papers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936366">What is happening, from the illegal worker's point of view, is that the employer had told them they did not need safety tickets. Counterfeit tickets are provided for a journeyman, boilermakers, etc. They are paid in cash, so there is no worker's compensation, no CPP deductions and no EI. If injured on the job, they are fired and sent home. We had a documented case where a person fell, broke his leg and was basically told to get on a plane and fly back to Colombia. That is what is happening on federally funded job sites in Alberta, B.C. and across the country. They do not do drug and alcohol testing. There is no avenue for these workers to report workplace safety issues. If they complain, they are threatened with deportation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936367">I am going to read from a Facebook post. It was posted in Spanish, but I have had it translated. It said, “Edmonton area cash-only projects. Five concrete finishers, six labourers, must have WHMIS, H2S certificates. If you don't have them, we'll provide them for you. Cash.” This was for a federally funded project.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936368">I will tell a story about a gentleman who fell. He said that he did not remember falling. He lost his memory for 24 hours and woke up in the hospital. His helmet saved him. It had broken in half, but he got a cut and a bump. He fell 25 feet because he didn't have a safety harness. He broke his shoulder and could not move for two months. Who was it who visited him at the hospital? It was the safety officer from this fake company, who came to threaten that, if this were to be reported it to WCB, he would be fired and deported. He said it was terrifying. When he got back after two months, he was told, “Here's your last cheque. Get out.” This is happening every day on federally funded projects such as the LRT in Edmonton, the Henday. I had the Library of Parliament put this together. This is billions of dollars, and jobs have been taken away from Canadians, legal Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936369">This is two-sided. We have Canadians who cannot get work, and we have the government funding illegal workers. We asked the government if we could investigate this at the operations committee, and the Liberals blocked it. A year ago, we gave this documented information to the Treasury Board with our offer saying, “We will work with you. We won't make it political. We won't make it a partisan issue. We'll work with you to fix it.” The government chose to side with human traffickers instead of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936370">If the government was serious about Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> helping Canadians and helping border issues, it would act on this issue now.</ParaText>

I have seen many bills in my time, and I have to say, I am concerned about the way this Liberal government operates. Right now, the House is also studying a bill to implement affordability measures that will put money back into Canadians' pockets, but it is not as good as what the Conservatives promised. We were more ambitious on behalf of Canadians. Still, Bill <Document DbId="13539746" Type="3">C-4</Document> is a step in the right direction for putting money back into taxpayers' pockets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936403"> What we saw yesterday was the Liberals filibustering their own bill. Filibustering means running out the clock to prevent a bill from moving forward. We are seeing this here today. The government added an extra period of time to the agenda so that we could talk about Bill C‑12. I am very pleased to be here with my colleagues today, but one of the reasons we are here is that the government is trying to draw out the legislative process. What I saw yesterday definitely met the definition of what the political world calls filibustering. </ParaText>

Does anyone know how many people who were being paid were in the room yesterday? Fifty. There were 50 people here who are being paid with taxpayer dollars. There were public servants there and they were forced to waste their valuable time. Our public servants have a huge amount of work to do, yet the Liberals invite these officials to appear during consideration of bills and waste their time. This shows a lack of ethics and a lack of respect for the public service, for the work we have to do and for the work public servants do. Yesterday, 50 people had to listen to a string of Liberal members filibustering for an hour and a half. I just wanted to raise that issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936405">The Liberals are back at it again today, and we are calling them out for it again. The member opposite brought up the fact that the government added an extra day for consideration of Bill C‑12. Once again, the government is doing this to drag out the process and keep the bill from moving forward. Is Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C‑12</Document> perfect? No, but we are going to work on it and suggest ways to improve it and make it better, because safety is paramount for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936406"> The Conservatives forced the Liberals to abandon Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C‑2</Document>, which would have violated individual freedom and the privacy of Canadians. The Privacy Commissioner even confirmed that the Liberals had not consulted him when they moved to acquire sweeping new powers that would allow warrantless access to Canadians' personal information held by service providers, such as banks and telecommunications companies. Law-abiding Canadians must not lose their freedom in order to make up for the Liberals' failures on borders and immigration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936407">This bill is important and we will work on it. We know that border security is an issue right now, especially when it comes to fentanyl, a drug that has had devastating consequences for some of our constituents. We must work to strengthen oversight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936408">The Liberals have brought Bill C‑12 here. As I said, we will examine it in detail to ensure the Liberals do not try to slip a small measure through that would violate the privacy rights of law-abiding Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936409">In this second attempt at a bill, the government is still not dealing with certain issues, like bail reform. It is also not discussing the practice of arresting and releasing fentanyl and firearms traffickers who take advantage of our porous border in order to attack Canadians. This is an ongoing issue. In our view, it is an important one. We will work to improve the bill and suggest some amendments. We have said that we are willing to work to move this bill forward. We are willing to move Parliament's business along for Canadians, but we need a government that is willing to work with us. Regrettably, what I have witnessed here in the past six months is a dysfunctional, disorganized government that does not help Parliament move forward with business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936410">Allow me to repeat what happened yesterday with Bill <Document DbId="13539746" Type="3">C-4</Document>: It was filibustering. We spent an hour and 20 minutes studying the bill in detail. Fifty people being paid by the government were there. It was sad to see. Canadians deserve better. Canadians work hard for their paycheques every day. They send us a large amount of money and expect us to manage it efficiently.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936411">We need to work together for Canadians. We need to bear that in mind every day, out of respect for our constituents. That is what we Conservatives want to do here. We are going to make suggestions, because the safety of Canadians is paramount.</ParaText>

I hope that it will be in connection with this reality, because the fentanyl crisis we are currently going through is absolutely devastating. It is killing Canadian men and women. Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe a single kilogram of fentanyl has the potential to kill up to two million people. This crisis is unprecedented. It must be taken seriously and I hope that we will be able to get it under control. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8936416">Madam Speaker, I would like to start with a comment, and then I have a question.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936417">First, I find it odd that my colleague is talking about filibustering in the House, since I have seen the Conservatives filibuster in committee on a number of occasions since I was elected in 2019, and that has delayed the committees' work. In fact, the Conservatives were often in the news last fall for their filibustering in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936418">Second, I am wondering how to formulate my question. There are two angles to consider. My colleague mentioned some figures and other aspects related to the fentanyl crisis. However, misinformation and disinformation are the main danger, as is widely recognized around the world. This is becoming a democratic issue. Decisions are no longer based on scientific facts, but rather on empty slogans. People can spin numbers to say whatever they want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936419">This brings me to my question. My colleague also talked about immigration. Does he recognize that Quebec is doing more than its share and that he should talk to his Conservative colleagues in the other provinces and encourage them to take in more refugees?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8936420">Madam Speaker, my colleague is talking about numbers, and numbers do not lie. Right now, unemployment is rising across the country, and youth unemployment is at its highest level in 25 years. We need economic immigration to help entrepreneurs grow their businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936421">That said, the Liberal government's decision to throw open the borders created a crisis, which we are seeing in the housing sector, the health care system, and other areas. This crisis is connected to what has happened. The important thing is to have economic immigration that will help Canadians develop and to make Canada one of the strongest countries in the G7.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8936428">Madam Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to rise in the House today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936429">As a Conservative member of Parliament, I am proud to stand and express my concerns with this legislation. I have heard from my constituents, and they have made it clear to me that the Liberal government is not going far enough to fix the messes it has created at our borders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936430">Conservatives negotiated the split of the original bill, Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, ensuring that one of the most egregious infringements on Canadians' privacy and freedoms was sidelined, while advancing measures that strengthen our border security and protect our communities. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is a step in the right direction, but make no mistake: It is only here because Conservatives held the line against Liberal overreach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936431">Let me start with the context. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> was born out of the Liberals' bloated Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, introduced in June 2025. The original bill included warrantless access to personal information and the forced re-engineering of tech platforms for surveillance, and it even allowed Canada Post to open mail without judicial oversight, measures the Privacy Commissioner himself confirmed were drafted without his consultation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936432"> As my colleague said, “Conservatives have successfully blocked the Liberals' infringements on individual freedoms and privacy in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>”, emphasizing, “Law-abiding Canadians shouldn't lose their liberty to pay for the failures of the Liberals on borders and immigration.” If law enforcement suspects something suspicious, they can get a warrant. It is that simple. Thanks to Conservative pressure, those poison pills are gone from Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, allowing us to focus on real security enhancements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936433">Let us dive into the substance of Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, which draws from the supportable elements of its predecessor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936434">Part 1 would amend the Customs Act to empower the Canada Border Services Agency, CBSA, to use private facilities free of charge for examining exported goods, mirroring its current authority over imports. This is crucial in combatting the export of stolen vehicles and contraband, which has surged under Liberal watch. According to the CBSA's own reports, auto thefts have become a multi-billion dollar industry, fuelling organized crime with thousands of vehicles shipped overseas annually. By extending the CBSA's reach, this provision would ensure that our borders are not a one-way street for criminals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936435">Part 2 of the bill would amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to create a temporary accelerated scheduling pathway for precursor chemicals like those used in fentanyl production. This would fill a critical loophole, but let us be clear that it is long overdue. Fentanyl has devastated Canadian families, with Health Canada data showing that in 2024, fentanyl was responsible for 75% of opioid overdose deaths, a staggering increase of 32% since 2016.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936436">Figures from January to March 2025 indicate that 63% of opioid toxicity deaths involved fentanyl, contributing to thousands of preventable tragedies. I must note that Canada will need to do a lot more than pass this bill to fix the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936437">While this part would ban precursors, it falls short by ignoring tougher sentencing for dealers, as Conservatives have long demanded. Still, it is a tool that law enforcement needs, and we believe in giving our first responders the tools they need to save lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936438">Part 3 would formalize exemptions for law enforcement officers from drug charges during legitimate investigations under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and Cannabis Act. This is straightforward common sense. Our officers should not fear prosecution while undercover fighting the very cartels flooding our streets with poison.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8936439">In part 4, amendments to the Oceans Act would enable the Canadian Coast Guard to conduct security patrols and share intelligence with defence and security partners. With increasing threats from smuggling and foreign interference, this would bolster maritime security without the overreach seen in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>. Canada has massive borders and we need to work with like-minded partners to enhance our protections and preserve our sovereignty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936440">Parts 5 through 8 address immigration integrity, a realm where Liberal mismanagement has been catastrophic. In particular, part 7 would extend authorities to cancel or suspend immigration documents in the public interest, and part 8 would introduce a one-year cap on refugee status filings while tweaking the safe third country agreement, the STCA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936441">Parts 9 and 10 target money laundering and terrorist financing. Part 9 would amend the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act to hike penalties, mandate compliance agreements with FINTRAC and expand registration to more entities. Let us not forget that money laundering in Canada is a big problem. It exceeds $100 billion, as reported last year. That is something the government has not paid attention to or has totally ignored dealing with or talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936442">The bill would also allow FINTRAC to share info with the commissioner of Canada elections. Part 10 would add the FINTRAC director to the financial institutions supervisory committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936443">These steps intend to combat the financial networks behind organized crime, which have thrived amid Liberal soft-on-crime approaches. Also, let us not forget, and let us make sure Canadians listening understand, that the government's soft-on-crime approach has put a tremendous pressure on Canadians' lives and inflation, because money laundering creates an underground economy, which is known to be happening on Canadian soil. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936444">Finally, part 11 would update the Sex Offender Information Registration Act and the Customs Act, clarifying reporting, allowing physical characteristic records and permitting the CBSA to share travel data with law enforcement to prevent sexual crimes. This would protect vulnerable Canadians, which aligns with Conservative priorities. It is time we start doing more in this House to protect vulnerable Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936445">This bill would cost money, but the real cost has been the Liberals' 10 years of failures: record overdoses, strained immigration systems and eroded public trust. The Conservatives look forward to the committee stage, where we will call for amendments for tougher sentences, real enforcement and protections for legitimate refugees. Only the Conservatives will deliver tougher sentences for lawbreakers and order at the border and will allow legitimate refugees to find sanctuary here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936446">In conclusion, Canadians deserve secure borders without sacrificing freedoms. I wish there were more Liberal speakers on their own bill. Unfortunately, they refuse to do that.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8936460">Madam Speaker, I know it is not exactly tradition to ask for a round of applause in this House, but our Conservative caucus deserves one today. That is because when the Liberals first introduced the bill in its original form, we fought long and hard against this disaster. It was because of our pressure that the Liberals backed down on the worst of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936461"> Thanks to the work of our Conservative caucus, the government has not given powers to Canada Post to open any mail, including simple letters, without a warrant. Our work stopped the government from banning cash payments and donations of more than $10,000. We stopped the government from having the ability to access personal information without first seeking a warrant. We stopped the government from being able to use Canadians' personal banking information if it suspected that someone was involved, in any way, in money laundering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936462">This is a list of groups that were insulted by the ham-fisted first attempt at the bill. In June, 300 organizations were opposed to the government overreach included in the first version of the bill, and it is quite a list. It included the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the BC Civil Liberties Association, the Canadian Labour Congress, the United Church of Canada, the Migrant Rights Network, the Canadian Council for Refugees, Amnesty International and OpenMedia. They are all opposed. It is hard to believe how many people the Liberals could possibly offend. They have to work hard to cause this kind of outrage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936463"> However, we are not done. There is more. The bill was also opposed by the HIV Legal Network, the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers, Climate Action Network Canada, the Centre for Free Expression, the Canadian Muslim Lawyers Association and the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council. Even with this newer, improved bill, there is still opposition from the likes of Amnesty International Canada and other organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936464"> These groups are working to protect civil liberties, data privacy and refugee rights, and they all strongly oppose the legislation. They say it tries to fast-track, rather than address, many aspects of the previous bill, which was called Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936465">It is shocking that the Privacy Commissioner said the Liberals did not even consult him before the bill was considered. They did not consult him when they were trying to grant themselves sweeping new powers. They wanted to access Canadians' personal information from service providers, including banks and telecoms. We are talking about access to vital personal information without so much as a warrant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936466">That is the kind of overreach that the Liberal government would have love to see. I know Canadians are rightly suspicious of government overreach, and they should be. We have seen how the Liberal government tries to take an inch and turn it into a mile.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936467">For example, let us look at what the Liberals are doing to law-abiding gun owners. The government is attacking law-abiding gun owners. In a typical Liberal overreach, the government is trying to force these good citizens to give up the legally purchased and owned guns that they use for hunting and sport shooting. This is the type of government control that alarms Canadians, and it is typical of the Liberals. They want an inch, and it somehow turns into a mile. Conservatives will continue to fight on that front. We will continue fighting so that law-abiding gun owners are not punished for wanting to hunt or go sport shooting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936468">At the same time, the government still refuses to have mandatory prison sentences for gangsters who use guns to commit crimes. We know that the vast majority of gun crimes are committed using guns that have been illegally smuggled across the border. It is not grandpa with his gopher gun who is committing crimes, yet the Liberals want to go after law-abiding gun owners. Can Canadians believe that? It is incredible. It is almost unbelievable.</ParaText>

If the Liberals get their way, by 2035, under the EV mandate, Canadians will not be able to buy new gas-powered or diesel-powered vehicles. Can we imagine that? This mandate is a punitive tax on drivers, because those EVs are very expensive, but it is so typical of these “Ottawa knows best” Liberals.</ParaText>

He barely even drives it in the winter because when he turns on the heater, as he tells me, it sucks so much of the battery that he worries he will not be able to get back and forth from work. Now the government has paused the mandate for a year. That is true, but it needs to be killed completely, and Conservatives will continue to fight this government overreach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936476">Now, let us get back to the legislation at hand. The Liberals claim that the new bill, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, would crack down on precursor chemicals, which is great. Those are the chemicals that are used to manufacture illegal drugs. At the same time, the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="318692" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> has recently refused to rule out approving additional legal drug consumption sites.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936477">This summer I toured the area around a major drug consumption site in my riding of Edmonton Griesbach with the Edmonton Police Service. To say it was a disaster is an understatement. These sites are allegedly, supposedly, used by addicts to safely inject drugs, including fentanyl, but the reality is that they are just not working. Unfortunately, on my tour, we noticed someone right outside the consumption site in my riding of Edmonton Griesbach injecting drugs. This site, I might add, is located not that far from a day care. What the Liberals are doing with these sites is shocking and appalling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936478">I have talked with police, and they say that these sites increase the amount of drug activity in the area. The drug dealers are naturally drawn to the area; they know they can sell their wares there. It is like a magnet for them, and we can see the sad, dejected people who are struggling with this illness. It has resulted in a spike in violent crime in the area, including murders. In addition, for all the people who argue that there is so-called safe supply, there is nothing safe about injecting drugs into one's system, especially fentanyl.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936479"> It is especially bad in Chinatown. My Edmonton riding includes half of Chinatown, and it is really tragic to see the effect on a community that was once thriving, vibrant and very safe. There was a bakery there that had been in business for 60 long years, but because of the kind of crime linked to these injection sites, the store had to close. They could not keep the addicts out of their shop. They had been broken into. Crime was rampant, and it caused this Canadian small business to close. That is so sad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936480">Now in Chinatown, the most common sight seems to be “for lease” and “for rent” signs, and it was once such a safe, thriving neighbourhood. I have seen the tragedy of people slumped in the streets, obviously struggling with addiction, and it is largely due to these consumption sites that the Liberals like to encourage. It is shocking that they encourage these sites.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936481">Does it not make sense that, if we truly are a caring society, rather than pushing people into these sites, we do the humane thing and help people recover? Do we not owe that to the most vulnerable in our society? Do we not owe them that, as opposed to, in some cases, watching them die on the street?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936482">As I have mentioned, the original version of the bill, Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, included significant changes to the immigration system. My riding has a significant amount of immigration casework. I live in a very diverse riding. I recently hosted an event to welcome new Canadian citizens in Edmonton, but we know the Liberals have been very poor on that front. They have broken the immigration system. Conservatives will continue to fight on all these fronts.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8936496">Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise on behalf of the citizens of Calgary Centre and speak about the new bill that is before us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936497">The actual title of the bill is an act respecting certain measures relating to the security of Canada's borders and the integrity of the Canadian immigration system and respecting other related security measures, but I say we should call Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> the short Liberal title, “We broke the immigration system, and we messed up public safety, border security and law enforcement, but do not worry; we are back to fix it because we know what we are doing.” In other words, it could be called “I break it then fix it. It is my version of job security”, or “If I did not break it first, how would anyone know how good I am at fixing it?”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936498">It is the classic Liberal playbook: They break the system then hold a press conference to announce they are fixing it. They light the fire then show up with a watering can and call it leadership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936499">The issues we have to address in the bill are based on several parts of the bill. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> has numerous parts to it, but a couple of objectives: security of Canada's borders, of course, and the integrity of the Canadian immigration system. For the sake of the public who may be following, I will break down further what is known as an omnibus bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936500">The bill is composed of 11 parts that would amend various statutes, including the Customs Act, the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the Cannabis Act, the Oceans Act, the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Act, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act and its regulations, the Retail Payment Activities Act, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act and the Sex Offender Information Registration Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936501">There is a lot for me to unpack. There is an option for me to spend 10 minutes talking about a plethora of sources and what we can do with the bill going forward. It started with Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, much of which was pressed on the government by the Trump administration in the United States, which forced us to look at some of the security measures that were not happening in Canada at that point in time. We were pushed to the wall to actually accomplish some things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936502">The bill came back to the House. The opposition, my colleagues, revisited it, and the Liberal government has taken out of the initial bill a bunch of the quite offensive parts that would really have impeded civil liberties. The government has come back with Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, which would actually address some of the issues that have long been simmering in Canadian society and have caused significant problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936503">Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> was an error, a Liberal misstep, and now we need to rectify it. If the Liberal government really needs help drafting the kind of legislation that actually works, my Conservative colleagues and I are willing to write the legislation for them to make sure we get the security we need in this country, both in the immigration system, which we have seen explode in the last number of years, and in the border security realm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936504">There are a number of things going on in the bill for me to pick from. Let us note that it is a fix for the Liberal government's first attempt at the bill, but we must go through fixes in the House at times, and we are willing and happy to do that with this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936505">I would like to speak to the issues of the illicit drug trade, organized crime, money laundering and human trafficking. For 10 years, the Liberal government has been duly informed of these attacks on Canada's expectations of maintaining peace, order and good government in this country. There are problems that have been evident for a long time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936506">Money laundering was addressed in budgets delivered by the government, but it never took any action. Dealing with organized crime and the illicit activities that go with it were always kicked down the road. It has been all talk and no action. Let me say that ignoring the avails of organized criminals is, by default, accepting the consequences of organized crime.</ParaText>

This has visited misery upon their families, upon our streets and upon our society in general.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936508">Let me share a personal story. Last January, across the street from my office, I went to pick up my dry cleaning, and there was a young man dying on the sidewalk. I was the first person on the scene. I got on my knees and did everything I could to get that man's heart beating. One thing runs through a person's mind: their kids.

              <ParaText id="8936513">One of my proud moments as the member of Parliament for Calgary Centre was my opposition to a second so-called safe consumption site in downtown Calgary, at a place called the Calgary Drop-in Centre, where homeless people can go in Calgary. It is right next to Chinatown, a very important part of downtown Calgary, and to a new development called East Village.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936514">East Village is an area that was built to bring families back downtown. There are lots of nice towers with three-bedroom condos in them. During that time, families were actually leaving because they did not want to raise families on streets that were trafficked by the drug pushers and criminals looking to profit from people's addiction. Imagine one's kids in that type of area.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936515">Think about the homeless people themselves, who have to go through a gauntlet of death in order to get to a homeless shelter. This was never a solution. It was brought forward as a potential solution by the provincial UCP, the United Conservative Party government. The New Democrats, provincially, were all onside, and I will correct my colleague on the other side: The federal Liberals were onside.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936516">I was the lone opposition for some time. Certain members of city council came to join me in that fight, and in the end, there was no safe consumption site opened at the drop-in centre, which serves some of the people in Calgary who need our help the most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936517">The solution was never a solution. We need to get back to what the real solutions are. The real solution is, of course, to win at the source, and that source is the criminals who are moving this scourge upon our population: the drug pushers, organized crime and the people who are making money at the expense of society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936518">I propose that we move the bill eventually to committee and actually make those changes that would make the laws more strict for the people who are actually causing the death and destruction in our society and that would make sure we make them pay. Crime should not be a risk-free, profit venture. We need to end this as quickly as possible and make sure the criminals are accountable for their actions.</ParaText>

We understand that and we are willing to get this bill to committee. Can we make changes to the drug-pushing laws? Can we make changes to the half measures, as opposed to the immigration asylum system, that are part of this bill?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936524">We would love to see this bill roundly discussed and those amendments clearly made at committee. We will be working toward that end.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8936532">Madam Speaker, that is a very good question. I thank my colleague for arriving with the data. It is important because making announcements is something we have talked about. As I said in my speech, it is all talk and no action. It is the same with the Canadian Armed Forces and the notion of improving the Canadian Armed Forces and getting back to a base. The Liberals talk about increasing the numbers, yet recruitment does not show any increase in the numbers whatsoever. It is the same with police. The Liberals talk about having 1,000 more police and border officials at customs, yet the hiring practice does not seem to be happening at all.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8936534">Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to rise again in the House of Commons to represent the people of Peace River—Westlock.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936535">Today, we are talking about Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, which sounds a lot like Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>. Bill C-2 has been replaced by this bill. It was less than a month ago that I stood in this place and gave a speech on Bill C-2, during which I outlined a number of deficiencies that I saw with the bill. When I heard the Liberals would be reintroducing Bill C-2 as Bill C-12, I mentioned a number of things for consideration as possible fixes and the concerns I had with the bill. I was hopeful they had the opportunity to listen to my speech and would address a number of the concerns I had. Unfortunately, it does not look like the Liberals listened, once again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936536">I want to address a number of things that were asked of us. At the time, the member for <Affiliation DbId="317752" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> pointed out that Canada Post needed to be able to open people's mail without a warrant, but then he said it was with a warrant. Interestingly, that has now been dropped. I guess that was something the Liberals recognized as a problem. I talked about the banning of cash payments and donations over $10,000 and said we had concerns with that, and that piece has also been dropped. Kudos to the government on that. The pressure from Conservatives caused that to happen as well. Then we talked a lot about concerns regarding warrantless access to information. These are some of the most dangerous parts of Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> and they have been dropped, and I am pleased about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936537">At the time that I gave my speech, about a month ago, I was reprimanded and chastised by the members opposite, who said that we should get out of the way and let the bill pass quickly. We saw right away that there were major concerns with Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>. I remember, in particular, that I was challenged on allowing Canada Post to open people's mail, as if we needed this to fight the fentanyl being mailed out. I am interested in knowing if members opposite still hold those positions and why these things have been dropped. I can tell the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> that my constituents and those across the country thought this was a dangerous inclusion in the bill, and I am happy to see that it is gone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936538">We have always worked hard to fight for everyday Canadians, and one of the other areas of concern was about the $10,000 donations. We see that the government continually goes after the freedoms that Canadians enjoy in Canada, and we see its subtle and dogged attack on things like charitable organizations in this country, whether it is through the recommendations that came out of the finance committee last year about stripping religious organizations of their charitable status, the Canada summer jobs changes or the charitable attestation changes. Now we see a ban on cash donations. The Conservatives will always stand up for the charitable sector and the good work it does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936539">The bulk of my speech last month was about the Sex Offender Information Registration Act and the changes being made to it. I had not had the time to look at it in detail. As members know, when there are amendments to a piece of legislation in the abstract, it is often difficult to see what they are, but since then, I have had a chance to put them in their place in the act and see what kind of effect they would have. I was concerned at the time about the passport markings the Conservative government had put in place and the ability to revoke the passports of folks who are registered to the sex offender registry, and there has been zero action by the government over the last 10 years on either marking passports or revoking them. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8936540">I have been digging into this a bit, and I discovered that one of the issues is that the RCMP, which holds the registry, is unable to share this information with other levels of government, other organizations and other law enforcement agencies. The bill says that we could share it with other law enforcement agencies, but the challenge is that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada is not law enforcement. The folks who issue passports are not law enforcement, so the bill is unclear. I do not think it will solve the problem of passport marking and the revocation of passports based on the registered sex offender list. This continues to be a problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936541"> I reached out to stakeholders who work in this space, like the folks from Ratanak International, based out of Vancouver, who flag this for me regularly. Registered sex offenders, convicted sex offenders, here in Canada often go abroad, likely to perpetrate more crimes. Countries around the world are pleading with Canada to alert them that a registered sex offender is coming or to prevent them from coming in the first place by withholding their passport. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936542">I noted last time in debate the reality that a passport has, in the opening page, an endorsement of the individual. It endorses the individual and asks those viewing the passport to give the person free passage through their country. I am not convinced that folks in the sex offender registry are necessarily entitled to a passport. The law has been changed already so we can revoke these passports, but the Liberal government has failed to do this over the last number of years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936543">The RCMP was able to share with me how many notifications it had of sex offenders travelling. I see there is an update to the notification process. In 2022, the RCMP was notified 1,700 times. In 2023, it was notified 2,200 times. In 2024, it was notified 3,300 times. That was for registered sex offenders travelling abroad. However, the RCMP noted that it is unable to track the number of sex offenders who leave the country, given that if a sex offender does not register to do this, the RCMP does not know. We often know when they come back, as they seem to get flagged in the system then. As they come in, border security gets notified, but we do not know how many leave. Also, the RCMP was unable to ascertain how many times a registered sex offender failed to register when they left, because it does not track this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936544">For most of the last decade, countries, particularly the United States, have been begging and pleading with us to share this information with them. I think the bill would cover that. The changes the bill would make would allow our law enforcement to share with American law enforcement that a registered sex offender is travelling across the border. It is a particular annoyance for the Americans, and I understand that at a time when we are trying to mend relationships with the United States, rectifying this particular annoyance is the thing to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936545">I would point out that I had flagged this for a number of years prior to this situation. I noted that, proactively, the United States has been sharing this information with us. In the first half of 2022, 165 Americans convicted of child sexual offences were allowed entry into Canada. We know this because the U.S. has a whole system to notify Canada that these folks are coming. Another question is whether we can stop them or refuse them entry, but that is another question altogether. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936546">I look forward to seeing some of the questions I have about the bill clarified in committee. I also look forward to seeing if we need an amendment to fix the passport issue.</ParaText>

They work hard; they follow the rules, and they expect their government to do the same. They believe the purpose of government is not to manage their lives but to protect their freedoms, the freedoms that their parents and grandparents fought to defend. That is why they see through the government's latest deception.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936562">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the so-called strengthening Canada's immigration system and borders act, sounds like something impressive. However, as in most Liberal bills, the title and the truth are strangers. The bill does not strengthen our borders. It strengthens the hands of a tired government that has lost control of spending and is losing control of our streets. It does not fix the broken system; it covers the cracks with slogans. It does not make Canadians safer; it makes them easier to watch, easier to tax and easier to silence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936563">I come from a part of the country where words still matter. When a man gives his word, he keeps it. When he breaks the law, he goes to jail, not on vacation. The government has broken its word again and again to families who cannot afford a home, to victims who cannot find justice and to newcomers who did everything right and are still waiting years for an answer while illegal migrants go to the front of the line.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936564">The same government that cannot guard our borders now wants to guard our bank accounts. Of course the Liberal government wants to guard our bank accounts: It has not tabled a budget in 18 months, and it has spent all of its own money. The same people who cannot stop fentanyl from coming in want access to Canadians' private data going out. The government calls that progress. It is the fox guarding the henhouse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936565">Let us talk about safety, because that is what is really at stake here. In my riding, we have seen the human cost of the Liberal government's failure in law and order. Families are shattered by addiction, my own included. No family is left untouched. In our communities, police are doing their best, but they have fewer and fewer tools to support them in doing their jobs and enforcing our laws.</ParaText>

Compassion without courage is cowardice, and the government has made a policy of cowardice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936567">Catch-and-release bail remains the law of the land. Drug dealers and gun traffickers get house arrest. Meanwhile, law-abiding hunters and farmers are treated like criminals for owning tools their families have used for generations. This is not justice; it is a failure. My constituents know the Liberal logic has failed us for a decade now, but Conservatives are focused on real change and law that will protect law-abiding Canadians. That is why we are proposing a shift in the Criminal Code to reflect castle law, the notion that a person's home is their castle.

              <ParaText id="8936568">Canadians do not want fentanyl traffickers watching Netflix on their couch. They want them behind bars where they cannot poison children. While the government lets criminals walk free, it punishes the people who play by the rules. The government punishes the same people who plough the roads at 5:00 a.m., coach a hockey team at 7:00 a.m. and still find time to shovel a neighbour's step before work. Those are the people the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> looks down on. Those are the people he calls “fringe”. He is focused on telling them what kind of car they can drive, but those are the people who built this country and who continue to build it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936569">Let us talk about immigration. Conservatives believe that Canada is made stronger by those who come here legally, who work hard, who learn our languages, who share our values and love our flag. Immigration must be founded in law, not luck, and in fairness, not favouritism. Under the Liberal government, our system has become a revolving door for those who exploit it and a brick wall for those who respect it. There is no compassion in chaos.

Even though it was a major bill, a gag order was nevertheless quickly imposed. Now the same thing is happening with Bill C-12, a bill that even the government acknowledged caused many people a great deal of concern in its previous version, Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>.

              <ParaText id="8936591">Mr. Speaker, it is always an honour to rise in the House to speak. I will be speaking to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, an act respecting certain measures relating to the security of Canada's borders and the integrity of the Canadian immigration system. What a laughable title from a government that has made such a mess of both our borders and our immigration system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936592">Let me talk about the mess the government has made of immigration. I want to share three short stories. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936593">The first is the case of Mr. Khant from earlier this year. He was a permanent resident, originally a citizen of India. He pleaded guilty to attempting an indecent act. That is a bit of a legalistic way of saying that Mr. Khant tried to purchase sexual services from a minor. Unfortunately for Mr. Khant, the person he tried to purchase sexual services from was the Peel Regional Police human trafficking unit, as part of Project Juno. Rather than a jail sentence, Mr. Khant received a conditional discharge. Why would that be? In the words of the court, “Mr. Khant is a permanent resident seeking Canadian citizenship and professional licensing. A conviction would not only delay his citizenship by four years but could also prevent him from sponsoring his wife and obtaining his engineering licence.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936594">If people commit crimes in Canada and they are not Canadian citizens, they should no longer be in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936595">Just over two weeks ago, there was the case of Mr. Sajeevan, an Indian citizen in Canada on a student visa. He was a roommate with several others, including several female roommates at a home in Barrie. His bedroom was in the basement beside the laundry room, which was shared by all the residents. The laundry room was beside the bathroom, which was also shared amongst the roommates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936596">Over a period of many months, Mr. Sajeevan used a peephole in the laundry room to spy on his female roommates in various states of undress. In July of this year, Mr. Sajeevan pleaded guilty to voyeurism, despite some initial agreement on sentencing and some very troubling victim impact statements from those who had been spied upon. The court went on to say, “The emotional and psychological harm caused is palpable...Mr. Sajeevan's offending has had a significant and enduring impact on his victims.” The court called it “more than curiosity; it was sustained predation”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936597">Despite all that and despite the serious nature of the crime and its effect on its victims, which the court acknowledged, the court went on to accept “serious collateral immigration consequences”. The result was a jail sentence of only five and a half months. Why? That is a bit of a strange number. Why five and a half months, when in fact the court said the proper sentence should be somewhere between six and 12 months?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936598">It was because a jail sentence of six months would have made him inadmissible to Canada. In other words, he would have had to leave Canada if he were to receive a sentence of six months. However, we did not get that because the Liberals have so screwed up our immigration system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936599">Last is the case of Mr. Biron, a permanent resident from the Philippines. In 2021, over four years ago, he pleaded guilty to sexual assault against a minor and was sentenced to 20 months in prison. Beginning in 2022, he was advised that he could be inadmissible to Canada because of the serious nature of his crimes. For over four years, he has fought his deportation. How can it be that a non-citizen who has pleaded guilty to sexual assault against a minor is still in Canada after four years?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936600">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, despite being called a fix to our immigration system, does nothing for this. These are not isolated incidents, because we know that, despite the strong border rhetoric and the fix to immigration allegedly coming from the government, we have lost track of hundreds of serious criminals in this country. The cherry on the top of this is that the very <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> responsible for our public safety is himself interceding on behalf of members of terrorist organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936601">Let me turn to the border and talk about what a mess the government has made of our borders. Fentanyl, of course, is still making its way into Canada. In fact, earlier this year, in the town of Georgina, in my riding of York—Durham, the York Regional Police broke up the largest drug trafficking ring in our town's history, under Project Madruga, through which 1400 grams of fentanyl were discovered. To put that into perspective, two milligrams is enough to kill a human adult. The York Regional Police said that they had never seen a drug trafficking problem or ring of this size or scope in Georgina. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8936602">The government promised during the election to hire 1,000 new border officers, but we have discovered that was just another empty Liberal promise. More than six months later, they have hired only a few dozen and, in fact, do not have a plan to hire any more. The CBSA says that it has turnover of between 600 and 700 officers a year, so even at normal speeds, it would take over five years to hire 1,000 new officers. The <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> himself admitted in an interview that it would take five years to hire 1,000 new officers, and that is not even talking about the backlog and vacancies the CBSA has. The Customs and Immigration Union says there is a 3,000-officer vacancy rate and shortage on the border force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936603">Last, I want to talk about civil liberties because, for all these messes, whether it is the mess on the border or the mess in our immigration system, for some reason, it seems the Liberals' response is always to attack our liberty. The monstrosity that is Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, from which Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> emerged, is just one more example of the pattern of the Liberal disregard for the freedoms and liberties of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936604">To be clear, I want to make a point that our freedoms, my freedoms and everyone's freedoms in Canada do not emanate from Parliament or princes. We have freedom and liberty, because we are made in God's image and are human beings endowed with those by our creator, but Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> remains before the House. It would allow law enforcement to snoop on Canadians without judicial authorization. It would allow Canada Post to open mail without a warrant. As a lawyer, I know that a warrant is a basic protection that we, as normal, average citizens, have fought for hundreds of years to maintain to protect us from the arbitrary power of the state.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936605">Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> is not the only attack on liberties that Canadians have endured under this government. Bill <Document DbId="13563649" Type="3">C-8</Document>, which we have discussed, would give unprecedented power to the government to kick Canadians off the Internet, on “reasonable grounds” in respect of “any threat”. What is “any threat”? I have been here for just over six months, and I have already been accused several times, by members from the opposite side, of spreading misinformation because they do not like my opinion. Am I now a “threat” to the government, and will I be kicked off the Internet? There would be no warrant, no trial and no due process. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936606">Another example is Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, which has more unprecedented power for the police to control and to police speech on the Internet. Over all, it seems like, of the legislation the Liberals have introduced thus far, the majority trample on our liberties as Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936607"> This is the Liberals' pattern. They might have a new leader and call themselves a new government, but they exhibit all of the same habits as they had before. Whether it is with Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="13563649" Type="3">C-8</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> or now Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, it seems for every societal problem, there is another Liberal bill ready to erode our freedom, my freedom and the liberty of all Canadians.</ParaText>

The Liberals do not have faith in Canadians that they can run their own lives or decide what they want to read or watch online or on the Internet. Instead, for every societal problem the Liberals see, it is more government intervention, more government censorship and more government bureaucrats telling them how they should lead their life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936621"> I am part of this party because we believe in Canadians. We believe Canadians are smart enough, wise enough and capable enough to run their own lives without any instruction from the Liberal government.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8936626">Mr. Speaker, when I heard about Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, I was hopeful. I was hopeful because I believed that the Liberals had listened to what both Canadians and Conservatives have been saying about Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>. On the surface, it looked like there was some reason to hope. Bill C-12 is a repackaged and less offensive version of Bill C-2. It does remove the most egregious of the sweeping new powers that the government sought to grant itself and other government agencies. It no longer proposes to restrict Canadians' use of cash, and it no longer proposes to allow Canada Post to open Canadians' letters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936627">The Conservatives in the House gave voice to Canadians in speech after speech and forced the government to back down from a bill that would have violated Canadians' individual freedoms and privacy. We are prepared to do our job once again with Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> as the country's loyal official opposition. The Conservatives will examine every clause and every line of the bill to make sure the Liberals do not erode Canadians' rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936628">After listening to the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> speak on television last night, on television instead of in the House, in front of an audience that even the Toronto Star described as being made up mostly of Liberal staffers, where he does not have to answer our questions and where he does not have to debate, I realized something else about Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>: It might be better, but it would not do what the people of Nanaimo—Ladysmith so desperately need it to do. It would not do what British Columbians need it to do, and it would not do what grandmothers across the country who are raising their grandchildren because of fentanyl need it to do. It would not actually secure our borders. It would not actually treat those in our communities who are in the thrall of fentanyl. It would not actually bring safety back to our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936629">While the bill would fill a loophole by banning precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl, it fails to address the sentencing of those who traffic in it. There are still no mandatory prison sentences for fentanyl dealers. There are still no serious penalties for those who profit from destroying our lives and our communities. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would make some incremental improvements, but they are beyond insufficient. Criminals who traffic in fentanyl and firearms will continue to use our porous border to victimize Canadians, and they will continue to walk free soon after being arrested.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936630">I will give the government credit where it is due. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is way better than Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, but let us be honest. These measures fall far short of what Canadians deserve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936631">The Liberals continue to permit drug consumption sites near schools and day cares. Last week, I had a call from a constituent about a proposed wet housing site that would back onto a kindergarten in my riding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936632">At the health committee, my Conservative colleagues called on the government to shut down fentanyl consumption sites near the places where kids learn and play. The <Affiliation DbId="318692" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> refused to do so. She would not rule out approving more of these sites, even after acknowledging that they are now repositories for rampant fentanyl usage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936633">Last night, the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> looked Canadians in the eye and spoke yet again of the need for transformational change. He spoke of a rupture, of sacrifice, of responsible choice and of generational investments. Well, the addictions crisis is still in full bloom in Nanaimo, and the numbers are still staggering across Canada. There were more than 50,000 deaths in the last decade. There are more victims of the addictions crisis than there were Canadian deaths in the Second World War. Some 79% of accidental opioid deaths in 2024 involved fentanyl, up 40% since the Liberal government came into power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936634">The number of emergency department visits linked to fentanyl has more than doubled since 2018. Superlabs in Canada are now producing massive amounts of fentanyl. These are not small operations pressing pills in basements. These are industrial labs producing drugs on a massive scale.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8936635">In a country of 41 million people, it is simply disingenuous to argue that with the multiple drug busts in the 96 million dose range, these drugs are meant for domestic consumption. We have to face the reality that drugs are being produced in Canada for both domestic consumption and export. Bust after bust is described as the largest, most sophisticated illicit drug lab in the country. Police seize kilograms of fentanyl; kilograms of meth; illegal unregistered firearms, many of them loaded; silencers; explosives; and millions of dollars in cash.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936636">This is what we are up against. Productivity in Canada is down, and we have a massive wage gap with the United States, except for criminals. Organized crime has set up an innovation sandbox in Canada that boggles the mind. The criminals know how to use AI, how to improve efficiencies and how to find synergies, and they are eating the government's lunch. Why? It is because the Liberal government, for all the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s rhetoric, only seems willing to tinker around the margins with tiny pilot projects and token funding announcements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936637">Yesterday, we had another one of these, with the Liberals proudly announcing $4.3 million in funding, including $442,000 and change for the city of Nanaimo, to address these issues. I will take their money, but I will vote with my conscience. For those following Nanaimo's news, $442,000 is barely enough to build a fence around city hall. It is nowhere near enough to meet the need in a community that has been devastated by the addictions crisis. In Nanaimo, we need the government to spend less and invest more. We need hundreds of millions of dollars in investment for real solutions, not a few thousand dollars of spending for a press release.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936638">If someone gets diagnosed with cancer, they get a full continuum of care: a diagnosis, a prognosis, surgery, chemo, radiation and follow-up for life. If someone gets diagnosed with addiction, they get Narcan. They might get patched up, if they are lucky, and then they get dropped off on the curb. This is not a system of care; it is abandonment. We need triage beds. We need detox beds. We need treatment spaces, recovery centres, sober-living houses and long-term maintenance programs. We need real treatment and recovery options so people can come home to their families, clean and healthy, and we needed it a decade ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936639">The <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> started his tenure in the House with lofty comments about Athens and Rome, but now he seems content to fiddle while Nanaimo burns. The Prime Minister is absolutely right. We need transformative change, but he is unwilling to deliver it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936640">I challenge the Prime Minister to come down from his ivory tower and engage with us in Nanaimo. I know he comes to my riding. He has family there, but I challenge him to spend less time jogging around beautiful Westwood Lake and more time talking with the people who deal with the addictions crisis on the front lines on our streets. He talks a good game about collaboration, but he does not collaborate. He talks about transformational change, but he is not even having the conversations that would allow him to make it. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is proof of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936641">The Conservatives forced the Liberals to back down from the worst parts of Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, and we will continue to hold them to account on Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, because Canadians do not want more photo-ops, press releases or the seventh announcement of the 1,000 border officers the CBSA has never heard of and has not been given actual instructions to hire. They want real change. They want safe streets, healthy communities and a government that values their lives more than it fear losing an election.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936642">Grandmothers want to stop raising their grandchildren. Addicts want hope, and communities want to stop living in fear. That is what the Conservatives are fighting for, and that is what a Conservative government would deliver. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8936660">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak in the House, as always.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936661">Today we are talking about Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>. It is a fairly large omnibus bill that would amend many different acts, and it goes into many different areas of national policy. It is a second attempt by the government to put forward a bill that would address a number of problems that are well known and well identified, problems that Conservatives have identified for years. The government has finally acknowledged the existence of some of these problems and is trying to fix them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936662">The Liberals came out with Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, literally the second bill tabled in the current Parliament. It was a disaster; it fell very flat. Nobody wanted the bill. It contained some terrible measures, including a bizarre outright ban on certain cash transactions, as well as warrantless mail opening. Who was asking for this?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936663">I suppose the government does deserve credit for listening to Conservatives, who had encouraged it through opposition to these measures to try again, so here we are with a new bill. It is a curious mix of ideas plagiarized from the Conservative Party in its previous platform, symbolic announcements that were not fulfilled with follow-through, and some steps for improvement on things that need to be done. I will talk about only a few of them, as it is a huge omnibus bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936664">With respect to the border, yes, Conservatives support export tracking in our ports. This is something Conservatives have for years called for. We talked years ago about the crisis of auto theft in our country and the need to have the ability to scan container ships for the thousands of cars stolen from Canadian streets. Members may remember that the then minister of justice had his own ministerial car stolen at least twice, maybe even three times; I do not remember for sure. This is the level of problem we have that the Liberals are trying to solve. We would support that. In addition, with respect to drugs, we certainly support changing the classification of precursor chemicals to controlled substances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936665">However, I will point out that while the Liberals are taking credit for strengthening our border protection, something Conservatives had for years called for, the departmental plans for the CBSA and the RCMP do not support the announcement material that has come along with the bill, which we see if we take a cursory look at both the main estimates and the supplementary estimates. The supplementary estimates are there to make adjustments when changes in law, announcements or things like that come about, so the government can plan ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936666">The government's current plan for personnel with CBSA would be a net reduction of 600-odd personnel through to 2028. Once again, the Liberals have an A for announcement, but right now it looks like an F on follow-through, which has been the MO of the government for so long.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936667">With respect to fentanyl, we heard some heart-rending testimony from members of the House on the scourge of opioid addiction, with people dying in our streets. There is also the trafficking of fentanyl. Yes, we agree with the changes the Liberals have made in the bill; they are important and supportable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936668">However, the government is not enforcing the laws we have already. People who traffic in drugs are not getting the full weight of Canadian law as it is. We have a bail not jail regime that the government deliberately brought in as a consequence of its bills, Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> from former Parliaments, and that would not be fixed by the bill before us.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8936669">With respect to changes that would be made to the Citizenship Act and to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, again, this is a problem long in the making. There are right now 290,000 asylum claims in the queue. By comparison, at the end of the years of the former Conservative government, there were about 10,000 claims. We have jumped from 10,000 people to 290,000 people in the queue for adjudication of asylum claims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936670">It is no surprise how we got there. We got there from the tweet heard around the world, the #WelcomeToCanada tweet that explicitly encouraged economic migrants to cross into Canada in order to then apply for asylum. The conflation of economic migrants with migrants seeking asylum in Canada as refugees has been completely intermeshed under the government. It is just a disaster for everyone. It is not fair for all the people in the queue to have this queue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936671">For the people in the queue, there is an industry now in which we have seen that human trafficking is a factor. People have made a business out of helping economic migrants, desperate people indeed, come to Canada from a safe third country, mostly the United States. We called upon the government repeatedly to make exactly the point that is contained in the bill, to apply the safe third country agreement to the entire land border. It is very late coming to this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936672"> There is so much in the bill that it is hard to really do justice to any of it, but I want to spend most of the rest of my time on a very curious change that the bill would make. There would be an amendment to the Oceans Act that would place the Coast Guard under the ministry of defence, for budget purposes. It would still report, as an institution, to the Minister of Fisheries, the Minister of Transport and now also to the Minister of National Defence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936673">This change is an accounting trick the Liberals have done to try to fulfill the important obligation Canada has to NATO to increase its spending to at least the old agreed-to target and now to 5%. However, that would not change the capability of the Coast Guard; it would change reporting mechanisms and just move the budget from one column to another. Moving an expense budget from one column to another would not make Canada more safe and secure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936674">The ships would continue to be unarmed. They would continue to not meet NATO's own definition of a defence force. The closest things to armaments on these ships are shotguns used to scare off polar bears in Arctic patrol conditions, like firing a banger that is designed to make noise to scare away a predator. I am not even certain that I understand in what circumstance this would happen; perhaps it would be when going ashore, I guess, in the high Arctic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936675">That would not make Canada safer. It would not meet our actual NATO duty to defend our territory or to be deployable and help other countries. In this omnibus bill, the Liberals have snuck in an accounting trick just to help government members pat themselves on the back for increasing defence spending, when they would be doing nothing of the sort. All they would be doing is moving a number from one column to another.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936676">The bill is a great example of the type of legislation we have become used to, where the government has a nice title and a nice announcement but no actual efficacy or improvement for national policy.</ParaText>

In Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, part 4 talks about making the Canadian Coast Guard the responsibility of another minister, but it never defines the minister as being the Minister of National Defence. The member referred to it as an “accounting trick” and talked about how the Canadian Coast Guard does not have any armaments, weapons systems or surveillance equipment to do the job defined under Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, which is surveillance and security patrols.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936688">In the Oceans Act, which part 4 would amend, there is still a responsibility to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and to the Minister of Transportation.

              <ParaText id="8936689">Mr. Speaker, that is a fantastic question. I do not know the answer to it. It is a great question that the government will have to answer when this bill gets to committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936690">I mentioned in my speech the reporting to the Minister of National Defence, but the member is correct that the bill does not specify that. That was my presumption. Who will be in charge of the Coast Guard when this is all done, if Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> passes unamended? It is not clear to me from what we can see so far. This will have to be studied at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936691">The member's point is so important: Nothing has changed. The ships are not suddenly armed or equipped with surveillance technology and equipment. They are the same ships, unarmed, and are currently purposed for civilian use. Changing and adding a new minister and moving the expense from one column to another will not make Canadians safer.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8936692">Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise in the House, and today we are talking about Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936693">For those who do not know what Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is, it is the Liberal government's attempt at a do-over of Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, the border security bill. When Bill C-2 first came out, there was an outcry from the Conservative Party and civil liberties organizations across the country because of the numerous infringements of the Canadian Charter Rights and Freedoms. It would have been violated by Bill C-2, so the government was forced to take out some of these offensive violations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936694">Part 4 would allow Canada Post to open mail without a warrant. Part 11 would ban cash payments and donations over $10,000. Part 14 would allow warrantless access to Canadians' personal information on reasonable suspicion, which is a very low threshold. Part 15 could compel electronic service providers to re-engineer their platforms to help CSIS and the police access personal information, like a digital snoop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936695">Part 16 would allow the government to supply financial institutions with personal information if the info was useful for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes. Again, if there was a reasonable suspicion, they could get all of someone's financial information. What could possibly go wrong when the Liberal government gets someone's financial information? I think we learned that with the Emergencies Act when the government froze the bank accounts of Canadians. It is no wonder Canadians do not trust the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936696">I am happy to see all of these violations of people's civil liberties were taken out in the do-over. That is the good news.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936697">The bad news is that the government continues to go against people's charter rights and freedoms. We see a continual pattern of behaviour with the government. With Bill <Document DbId="11528728" Type="3">C-11</Document>, it tried to shut down people's freedom of speech. Bill <Document DbId="11668222" Type="3">C-18</Document> tried to mess with the freedom of the press. The freedom of religion issue is constantly coming up, with the Liberals trying to remove charitable status from churches and the Canada summer jobs program. We have to get to the details of this bill to make sure no funny business has been snuck in at the last minute. It is clear the government continually wants to take away the freedoms of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936698">Some improvements could still be made to this bill, and I want to talk about a few of those. The first one is in part 1. Part 1 would amend the Customs Act to allow the CBSA to use facilities free of charge for enforcement and access to goods for export, as it does for imports. The dilemma for me is that with the size of the fentanyl issue, the crime issues and the lack of security at our borders, there is no limit on how long somebody's warehouse or space could be seized to use for this kind of enforcement. Of course, that would come at the expense of whoever owns a warehouse or storage space.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936699">In border towns like Sarnia, there is not always a lot of space available at the border, so that could be even more far-reaching. The same is true for Windsor and a number of the other border crossings we have. I think some limits should be put on part 1 to make sure we do not unduly burden private businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936700">Second, let us talk about fentanyl. Fentanyl is a huge issue in this country. About 50,000 people have died of overdoses. The RCMP and CSIS have indicated that there are 400 fentanyl superlabs. I do not know whether they are being shut down, but Justin Trudeau said a very small portion of our fentanyl goes to the States. The reality is we really do not know, because shipping containers coming in from China are not being scanned and are going through the port of Vancouver and down to Seattle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936701">The precursors of fentanyl are not controlled or tracked. We do not know where they are going, so the people synthesizing fentanyl in these 400 superlabs are getting those chemicals from somewhere. One thing I like about the bill is that it adds some controls to traceability so we would know where those chemicals are coming in, where they are going and who is buying them. That would be helpful to the police.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936702">I think we should start doing what other ports in the world do, which is scan all the shipping containers. This is very important not just on the fentanyl issue but on the issue of people stealing cars. We definitely need an upgrade in our scanning capabilities.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8936703">One of the difficulties I have with putting laws in place in this country is the lack of enforcement of the rule of law. It is fundamental to our democracy, but the law is not really being enforced. We have people committing crimes in the country who are let out because the Liberals put in place Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>. Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> says that we have to give the least restrictive punishment, which is really bail or a fine, at the earliest opportunity, which is right away. We have people trafficking fentanyl or creating it in these labs, and even if they get arrested, they are back out on bail. Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> lets them have house arrest. How convenient is that for drug trafficking? They have to stay home, but people can stop by.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936704"> We need better enforcement of the law, because we know the Liberals are going to create more laws like Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, for example, which is supposed to address the rise in hate crimes. There are already laws in this country that could help in that regard. There were 113 Christian churches that burned to the ground. There is a law against arson. It should be enforced. Illegally blocking the streets is against the law, but the police are not enforcing it. Death cries to Canadians and various religions are hate speech. They are against the law. Again, it is about enforcement. As for shooting up schools, stealing cars, home invasions and extortions, we already have laws on the books for these things, but if we are not going to enforce them, we are not going to cure the problem. That is exactly the problem with introducing this border security bill. If there is no enforcement of any of the things in it, then it is absolutely meaningless.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936705">There are immigration measures in the bill, and we need to take action on immigration because it is out of control. Most Canadians would agree with that. We need immigration to build houses and for the nation-building projects we want. We have an aging population. We need more PSWs, nurses and doctors than can graduate from the educational institutions in Canada. We need people to come here and help build the country. I love the idea from our <Affiliation DbId="322132" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> of the blue seal program, to take the 50,000 doctors and nurses who already live in Canada and get them accredited so they can help out. It is definitely a great idea. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936706">For the last century, people have come here to work and to help build the country, and we want to continue that. What we do not need is more freeloaders showing up to claim asylum and have the Canadian taxpayer fork out $3,000 to $4,000 a month to put them up in hotels in Niagara Falls. That is more money than we give the seniors who built the country. It is more money than we give to Canadians living with a disability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936707">Then we see that the majority of these claims, after two or three years of putting these people up, are not eligible after we have spent a huge amount of the taxpayers' money. There are 300,000 of these individuals in the backlog. That is $15 billion a year taken out of the pockets of Canadian taxpayers for people we did not invite here. I think moving the IRCC office to the Toronto Pearson, Montreal and Vancouver airports to hear their claims right on the spot would be good. Then if they are not eligible, the cost of a plane ticket is a lot less than the cost of putting somebody up for three years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936708">At the same time, we need to reintroduce the fair and compassionate immigration system we had when the Conservatives were in charge, which did security checks so that we were not letting people into the country who were going to cause the kinds of crime and trouble we are sometimes seeing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936709">I think the immigration measures in the bill will help out. I do not think they go far enough. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="317693" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation> has done a great job of defining what ought to be done to fix the immigration system we have. I encourage anyone who does not follow her to listen to what she has to say on that subject.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936710">I want to talk a bit about making the border more secure. The Liberals have announced that they are going to hire 1,000 CBSA agents. The announcement was made months ago and nobody has been hired. We hear now that it might be done within five years. That is not the kind of response we need to get security in the budget.</ParaText>

One of them was when Justin Trudeau contravened section 119(1) of the Criminal Code, which says that a person who holds public office cannot take an action that benefits themselves or their family.

              <ParaText id="8936732">Today, I am going to be discussing Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>. This is the Liberals' second attempt at addressing our broken border and immigration system. It was introduced in the House recently, thanks to my Conservative colleagues' work and my work in forcing the Liberals to back down on their first border bill, Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, because of its serious violations regarding the freedom and privacy of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936733">As the official opposition, it is our job to scrutinize the government and oppose legislation when it is against the best interest of Canadians. The safety and security of Canadians is non-negotiable, and Conservatives have been clear: Canadians should not have to choose between having a secure border and having their civil liberties protected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936734">Given the scope and complexity of the bill, Conservatives proposed that Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> be split into two separate pieces of legislation, with one that is narrowly confined to border and immigration measures, to ensure that all aspects of the legislation receive proper scrutiny. I am pleased that, along with our other opposition members, we were able to successfully force the Liberals to table the new bill, which we will continue to examine thoroughly to ensure that the bill does not include any measures that would breach law-abiding Canadians' privacy rights. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> may be a starting point, but I believe it requires significant amendments and vigorous study at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936735">There is no doubt that tougher and smarter measures regarding borders and immigration are desperately needed to keep Canadians safe. While I am happy that the Liberals are willing to work with the opposition parties to address Canada's border security and immigration issues, it is important to note that much of the urgency surrounding the legislation is a direct result of 10 years of Liberal mismanagement. The Liberals have failed to take our borders seriously, resulting in increased gun smuggling, driving up violent crime; an immigration system that is completely out of control; a fentanyl crisis; and an increase in human trafficking. These are all destroying the lives of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936736">While Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> contains positive provisions to streamline investigations and improve information sharing, it falls short in addressing some of the pressing public safety concerns facing Canadians. The Liberals' failure to secure our border and crack down on organized crime has fuelled a fentanyl crisis and put countless lives at risk. The Liberals' reckless drug legalization experiment, combined with their soft-on-crime bill, Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document>, has fuelled Canada's deadly drug crisis. Bill C-5 scrapped mandatory jail for fentanyl production and trafficking, for example. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936737">Last fall, police dismantled the largest and most sophisticated drug lab in Canadian history, capable of producing multiple kilograms of fentanyl each week, along with caches of loaded firearms, explosives and half a million dollars in cash. Fentanyl is not just a drug problem; it is a public safety and national security risk and a crisis fuelled by organized crime and enabled by weak borders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936738">Part 2 of Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, as in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, would amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to fill a loophole in the act by banning precursor chemicals for fentanyl. This is an important first step, but the Liberals are addressing only a small part of the issue and doing too little, too late. Bill C-2 is silent on the tools police and prosecutors actually need to address this crisis. The Liberals' catch-and-release policies are alive and well for those who traffic in fentanyl and firearms. The principle of restraint in Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> directs the courts to release violent offenders on bail at the earliest opportunity, under the least onerous restrictions. The Liberals' persistence in allowing house arrest for serious offences, which include offences involving firearms, if members can believe it, continues to endanger lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936739">It is not just the fentanyl crisis the Liberals are playing catch-up on. Their failure to get serious on our border has allowed for an increase in illegal gun smuggling, driving organized crime in Canada. Gun crime has risen 130% since the Liberals took office. In July, the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself even said, “The vast majority of firearms, illegal firearms, firearms used in crime, come across our border.”</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8936740">According to the Toronto Police Service, 88% of guns used in crimes seized by the Toronto Police Service in 2024 were traced back to the United States, including 94% of the firearms that were seized. That does not sound like a very secure border to me and, unfortunately, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> does little to address the issue. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936741">Instead of investing in border security, the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> has doubled down on the Liberals' failed gun confiscation program, which he himself admitted is a waste of money that will do nothing to keep Canadians safe. The $742 million the Liberals say they intend to spend on gun confiscation could have gone to hiring 5,000 more police officers or CBSA officers or purchasing 300 port scanners. Instead of including measures in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> to ensure border officials have the proper resources needed to secure the border, the Liberals remain committed to targeting law-abiding hunters and firearms owners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936742">Having a secure border also means having a strong, robust immigration system that serves the needs of Canadians and aligns with our national interests. Parts of Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> attempt to address some of the challenges our immigration system faces after 10 years of Liberal mismanagement. Unfortunately, I am not confident that these measures by themselves will fix our broken system, which is clearly collapsing under the weight of Liberal mismanagement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936743">This week, the CBC reported that processing times for Canadian immigration applications have reached unprecedented lengths. Wait times, for example, for permanent resident applications are up to nine years for the caregiver pathway, up to 19 years for the agri-food stream and up to 35 years for entrepreneurs under the start-up visa stream. Even worse than that, if anyone can imagine, the Liberals have lost track of hundreds and hundreds of foreigners in this country who have criminal records and are due to be deported. Guess what, they have gone missing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936744">This backlog of applications, lack of accountability and inconsistent enforcement all stem from a government that has failed to plan, failed to listen and failed to act. Now, with Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the Liberals are scrambling to fix the very system they dismantled, but instead of thoughtful reform, they are reaching out for sweeping powers and vague regulations that permit activities rather than legislating requirements for change. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936745">Conservatives believe in responsible immigration in appropriate numbers to keep up with our health care, housing and job markets. We support measures that streamline processing, reduce backlogs and help newcomers integrate successfully, but we oppose policies that put power in the hands of ministers without proper oversight. Canada's immigration system needs complete, wholesale changes to ensure a secure border and prosperous nation, but those changes are nowhere to be found in <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936746">Like many Canadians, Conservatives want safe communities, secure borders and an immigration system that works for our country, not one that is collapsing under the weight of the Liberal government. The safety and security of Canadians is non-negotiable and, as the official opposition, Conservatives remain committed to implementing the tougher, smarter measures that are needed to keep Canadians safe. We are ready to support provisions in the bill that protect our national security and secure our borders while proposing amendments that would improve the bill and opposing measures that go against the best interest of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936747">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> introduces significant changes that require in-depth study to ensure the problems are addressed appropriately. At committee, Conservatives will scrutinize, debate and propose amendments to Bill C-12 and work together to ensure it achieves its stated goal of improving Canada's public safety and national security. Conservatives remain committed to securing our borders, strengthening our immigration system and cracking down on crime and chaos in our streets.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8936765">The bill is effectively the second attempt of the government at getting serious when it comes to public safety and dealing with our borders and with drugs. It is frustrating, because Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> was a giant omnibus bill that the government put forward. The Liberals effectively said, “Don't worry. Just trust us. It's fine”, within days of the bill's coming out, and it was the second piece of legislation the government put forward. It was one of its showcase pieces in the last session. However, civil liberty groups and Canadians came out from coast to coast to coast talking about the massive overreach of Bill C-2.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936766"> Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is effectively part of the Liberals' listening. It is an improvement on Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, because it was very clear that Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> was an intensely flawed bill that would have allowed Canada Post to open people's mail without a warrant, which would have been an overreach on Canadian civil liberties and the freedom of individuals, which is something Canadians hold dear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936767">Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> would have gone so far above and beyond, such as banning things like cash payments for anything more than $10,000. The legislation might not have actually been dealt with for a long time, and with where inflation is, it could have had massive impacts on the way many Canadians choose to do a number of things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936768">I am happy to see that some of those most troubling elements have in fact been removed. However, one thing we know is that crime is completely out of control in our country. My Conservative colleagues and I hear about it every single day from people in our ridings and from people we run into on the streets here in Ottawa or back home.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936769">One of the most common pieces I hear about in my riding of Fort McMurray—Cold Lake is the absolute frustration with the catch-and-release policies and our broken bail system. We all hear these stories; I do not think the Liberals are immune. Every single day there are stories of people out on bail who are charged with heinous crimes. In fact earlier this week, an Amber Alert went out for someone suspected of taking a young child. That person was out on bail and, unfortunately, actually killed his ex-wife.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936770">These are the kinds of realities Canadians are facing. People who have been charged and convicted for horrible crimes, violent offences and repeated violent offences, are getting out on bail time and time again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936771">It is so clear that more needs to happen to protect our communities from the ever-growing crime crisis. This is one of the reasons my Conservative colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="317835" Type="2">Oxford</Affiliation>, introduced Bill <Document DbId="13591943" Type="4">C-242</Document>, the jail not bail act: to strengthen bail laws and put public safety first once again in Canada. Basically, his legislation would reverse the Liberal principle of restraint that was brought in with Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, strengthen bail laws for serious repeat offenders and ensure that criminals with a history of violent crime would no longer automatically be released back into their community. This is one of the big challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936772"> The soft-on-crime Liberals for the last 10 years have absolutely destroyed public safety in our country, leaving more and more Canadians unsafe or feeling unsafe. Frankly, feeling unsafe is a problem. Whether someone does or does not break into a person's house at night, if the person is afraid that it is going to happen because it has happened to their neighbours and to other people around them, then that undermines the social fabric we have enjoyed in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936773">One of the big frustrations we have as well is that we cannot trust the Liberals to do what they say they are going to do. They said they were going to hire more RCMP officers. They have broken their promise to hire 1,000 more CBSA officers. After that, the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> was asked point-blank, and he denied any accountability, stating, “I’m not responsible for the hiring.” Well, there is a thing called ministerial responsibility, but the Liberals do not abide by any of that at all; that has become very clear.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8936774">We have had a decade of reckless, soft-on-crime policies that make more Canadians feel unsafe. Violent crime has increased by 55%, and gun crime is up 130%. Extortion is up 330% across Canada; that is wild. The Liberals are more focused on a gun grab boondoggle that is going to cost Canadians, on a conservative estimate, $742 million and that the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> himself admits is a waste of money and resources and is being pursued purely for political reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936775">We did some research, and one of the interesting pieces is that $142 million could pay for 5,000 RCMP officers. It could pay for 300 port scanners or 37,000 addiction treatment spaces, something that is near and dear to my heart, but instead the Liberals are putting it towards another boondoggle, going after law-abiding gun owners rather than dealing with the real issue, which is that we have a porous border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936776">One of the big reasons we have a porous border is that we have absolute mismanagement of federal ports by the Liberal government. This mismanagement of our federal ports has turned them into parking lots for stolen cars that then go on to disappear overseas. What we also end up with are drugs and illegal guns coming into our country. What the Conservatives have been calling for is more scanners at the ports, because criminals know those ports are a hot bed for crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936777">In fact, according to Peel detective Mark Haywood, the CBSA checks “less than one per cent of containers” leaving this country. Criminals know this, so illegal drugs and illegal guns flood into our country, and stolen cars flood out, further eroding public safety in Canada. On top of this piece that is very troubling about the border, the fire has been fuelled further by a decade of horrific Liberal drug policy and drug experiments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936778">There has been a dangerous and deadly drug legalization pilot project in British Columbia that removed tools from the RCMP, making our streets completely unsafe, leaving communities to suffer and providing no support to people who are struggling with addiction in this country. There was also the Liberal-NDP so-called safe supply experiment, which gave people with addictions large quantities of government-funded drugs, of hydromorphone and other dangerous narcotics, without any guardrails or pathways to recovery, which fuelled the addiction crisis in our country because the drugs were then being resold in the streets and online, oftentimes ending up in the hands of teenagers who then started their journey into addiction.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936779">These are just two examples of ways the Liberals have made things worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936780">We know that fentanyl is 100 times more potent than heroin; as little as two milligrams can kill a person. Through the lost Liberal decade, Canada has become a fentanyl manufacturing hub. <I>Breaking Bad</I>-style superlabs are popping up right across the country. Mass fentanyl production is mass murder, but Liberal laws let the monsters who traffic deadly drugs walk free every single day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936781">One of the good things I will point out that the legislation brought is that the Liberals are finally taking some action to ban the precursors that allow monsters to produce fentanyl. Chemical precursors are how they make these drugs, so the bill would finally get serious on that, allowing precursors to be banned. This would go a very long way in helping shut them down, but there would still be no mandatory prison time for fentanyl traffickers. There would still be no new mandatory prison time for gangsters who use guns to commit crimes, despite Liberal campaigns against them and against legal gun owners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8936782">What we will do, from this side, is continue holding the government accountable. We look forward to the bill's going to committee so we can further study it. Conservatives will continue to stand up for Canadian individuals' freedoms and privacy.</ParaText>

I also know the pride that comes from serving someone's own community and building something lasting. I have had the privilege of visiting many local businesses owners, listening to their stories, and learning about their successes and the challenges they face.

              <ParaText id="8937112">Yesterday, the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> spoke to young people. This might have been an opportunity for him to apologize for the 10 years of Liberal failures that have led to historically high unemployment for young people. We are now at a point where the employment rate for young people is the worst it has been in over 25 years. Youth unemployment is approaching half a million young people. It is approaching a rate of 15%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937113">What is the response of the government to this catastrophe created by its own policy decisions? It is to tell young people that they need to give up more, that they need to sacrifice more. This is the framing we see from the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It is not to take responsibility for the failures of the Liberals over the last 10 years, but to blame the victims of bad Liberal policies. The Liberal approach is to constantly frame the problems we face as a country as if they are somebody else's fault and somebody else needs to take action other than the people who made the policies that got us there in the first place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937114">We have put forward a Conservative youth jobs plan to reverse the harm done by the Liberals. We have invited them to adopt that plan, but not only have they failed to adopt our jobs plan; they have not even put forward a plan of their own. Their policies attacking energy and job creation, which are pushing the essentials of life out of reach, are making young people increasingly worried about their future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937115">I was at Concordia University in Montreal yesterday speaking to young people about the situation, asking them whether they were better or worse off than the previous generation. Many young people are worried about their future. They have already suffered so much, yet the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, rather than taking responsibility for 10 years of Liberal failures, is telling them that they will have to sacrifice even more. It is time for the government to stop blaming others and take responsibility for its own failures. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937116">As we talk today about Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the same is true when it comes to public safety and criminal justice. The government is constantly trying to externalize the source of these problems, yet we know that rates of violent crime were dropping prior to the current government coming into office and began increasing as soon as the government came into office. This is because the Liberal government made policy choices around more generous bail for repeat violent criminals. It made policy choices that got us here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937117">We will certainly study the provisions in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> in detail. We look forward to the study that will take place at committee. However, there has been a complete failure by the Liberal government over the last 10 years to take public safety and crime seriously. It has not recognized that it is Liberal bail, Liberal policy choices and bills proposed and passed by the government that got us into this situation in the first place. Rather than calling on other people to make sacrifices, the government should have the humility to recognize its own policy failures and how the choices it has made on the economy, on crime, on immigration and in many areas have led to a situation where young people are more pessimistic about the future than they used to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937118">We are here in this House to talk about restoring opportunity for young people and about restoring hope. I believe our country can have a bright future, but it is in the hands of the members of this House to make that future happen. It is not by sticking our heads in the sand like an ostrich that we make a future better for young people. It is by confronting the real data and real challenges when it comes to public safety and youth unemployment and making things better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937119">We call on the Liberals to adopt Conservative jail, not bail legislation and to adopt the Conservative youth jobs plan. Those are the solutions we need. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8937146">Mr. Speaker, it is always a privilege to rise on behalf of the people of Cambridge and North Dumfries in this place, especially to discuss an issue as important as our Canadian borders and keeping people safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937147">Everyone watching at home might remember that this is not my first time in the House talking about border security. A few weeks ago, I spoke about Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, which was introduced by the government with goals similar to those of the bill before us. I expressed my deep concerns with many portions of Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, including the parts that would allow Canada Post to open any mail without a warrant, ban certain cash payments and transactions, allow warrantless access to personal information, and let the government snoop on people's online activities and see deeply personal financial information from Canadian banks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937148">While this new piece of legislation, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, is intended to address many of the thoughts that I, many of my Conservative colleagues and indeed people from all across Canada had about that old bill, I am grateful that the government listened to our Conservative ideas and the voices of thousands of Canadians, including people in my community, to remove these problematic elements. This proves that the work Conservatives are doing in Ottawa is producing results for the people we serve. Legislation about border security should be about keeping our borders safe, not about completely separate topics like online surveillance, private business transactions and reading people's mail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937149"> Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is a small step in the right direction, but it is not without problems. I am really glad that the sections encroaching on Canadians' personal freedoms and privacy rights are no longer in the bill, but let us talk about what else is not in the bill. There is still no action to end Liberal catch-and-release policies, meaning people who smuggle drugs and guns across our borders can still be arrested, get released and go right back to breaking the law all in the same day. The Liberals are still allowing people who get arrested for the most serious crimes to serve what should be multi-year sentences in the comfort of their own homes. There are still no mandatory minimum prison times for fentanyl traffickers, gangsters who commit gun crimes and other heinous offenders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937150">This soft-on-crime agenda is not just an abstract idea; it is hitting home in my community every single day. Last week, there was a shooting on Dellgrove Circle and Baintree Way. A couple of months ago, bullets struck a home on Park Avenue and Grant Street. Back in June, a house on Roseview Avenue was targeted with six gunshots in broad daylight. These are not supposed to be dangerous places. They are quiet neighbourhoods where families should feel safe. My neighbours in Cambridge did not ask for their streets to become crime scenes. Ten years ago, this would have been unimaginable in a country like Canada and in a community like ours. These are not just headlines; they are real families, real neighbours and real lives disrupted by violence. Every time I hear about another incident, I think of the children growing up in fear and the parents wondering if their street is still safe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937151">People reach out to me constantly in emails, phone calls, texts and responses to my community surveys. They tell me, “I don't feel safe when I lock the door at night or when I let my kids play out in the yard.” They asked me to bring their concerns to the government. I have stood up time and time again in debate and in question period to let the government know just how badly it is failing law-abiding citizens. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937152">What does the Liberal government say in response? For years, the Liberals said, “Hold on, be patient, the legislation is coming soon”; that is, when they did not call us racist, conspiracy theorists or supporters of so-called American-style policies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937153">For this government, it has always been about doing something tomorrow instead of doing it today, about blaming someone else instead of taking ownership. The Liberals had an opportunity to fix the justice system in this very piece of legislation. They did not. The bail reform could already be reported out of committee by now. It is not; it is just getting started. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8937154">The Liberals had an opportunity to vote for Conservative legislation to put the bad guys in jail and end Liberal bail. They did not. They have ignored this problem for years; they have ignored the police officers, the mayors and the frontline workers. People in communities like mine are paying the price. Every day the government delays is another day criminals are allowed to break the law with absolute impunity, no deterrents, no consequences and no accountability. That needs to stop now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937155">Let us not forget who else is paying the price for this soft-on-crime, hug-a-thug approach: our emergency services, frontline workers, first responders and hospitals. Police are being stretched thin responding to repeat offenders who should never have been released in the first place. Paramedics are racing from one overdose call to the next, often with no time to recover between emergencies. Nurses and doctors are overwhelmed treating the fallout of drug poisonings, violent assaults and mental health crises, many of which could have been prevented if the justice system actually worked.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937156">Our first responders are doing their jobs with courage and compassion, but are being asked to do more with less. They are expected to manage the consequences of failed policies while the government continues to delay action and deflect responsibility. When the system fails to hold criminals accountable, it does not hurt just victims, but everyone who is trying to keep our communities safe and healthy. It puts pressure on our hospitals, shelters, outreach workers and emergency services. It creates burnout, frustration and fear. These are the people we rely on in our most vulnerable moments. They deserve more than lip service; they deserve a system that works. They deserve a government that stands with them, not one that leaves them to clean up the mess.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937157">While crime continues to rise, it is not the only crisis gripping our communities; the opioid epidemic is another tragedy unfolding in plain sight and one the government continues to mishandle. We see people living in tents in what used to be public parks and green spaces. We see people in doorways, on the sidewalk or the street corner who have lost everything they had because of one mistake. We hear the sirens of ambulances going to help someone who has had yet another overdose. Many people do not make it out alive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937158">These are not statistics; these are people who get a government in Ottawa that does not offer a helping hand or invest in recovery and treatment, a government that wilfully pushes hard drugs onto our streets through so-called safe supply sites. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937159">There is nothing safe about a government-funded institution that hands out drugs that can literally kill people, all for free. These so-called safe supply sites do not just keep vulnerable people hooked on the poison that is killing them; they also feed the opioid crisis even more because many of the drugs they give away end up on the streets. The <Affiliation DbId="318692" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> testified in front of a parliamentary committee just days ago that not only would she not commit to ending this radical experiment, she would not even commit to ensuring these sites are not placed next to places like schools in our community. That means a safe supply site in a city like mine could be put right around the corner from kids who are literally four or five years old. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937160">It seems like now everywhere has become a drug consumption site. I hear stories from parents who find needles and drug materials in parks and playgrounds, places we never would have dreamed of finding any of these things in just a few years ago. I find it a bit ironic that this bill is supposed to address the fentanyl flowing across our borders, all while the government continues to hand it out here at home and defend a regime that we all know has failed and is failing so many. If we truly want to stop the opioid crisis, then let us stop all the opioids, including the ones the government gives out for free in communities across Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937161">Concerns like these are ones my colleagues and I hope to address at upcoming committee hearings through amendments offered in good faith. We want to make this legislation stronger and better, because stronger legislation means better outcomes for the people we serve.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937162">I would say to the people of my community that they should know that I have one goal in this debate: to keep our communities safe and to finally put a stop to the scourge of crime, chaos, drugs and disorder that is sweeping across—</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8937182">Mr. Speaker, I am speaking today to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, a broad omnibus bill that, in its current form, seeks to make changes on a number of issues related to the border, immigration and crime prevention. I am thankful to my many constituents, and those throughout Canada, who added their voices of disapproval to its predecessor, Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>. They raised their voices against the infringements it sought to place on individual freedoms and privacy. That bill, Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, wanted to allow Canada Post to open any mail, including letters, without a warrant, ban cash payments Canadians use and ban the donations over $10,000 that our charitable organizations need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937183">It wanted to allow warrantless access to personal information. It could compel electronic service providers to re-engineer their platforms to help CSIS and the police access information, and it would have allowed the government to supply financial institutions with personal information if the info were to be used for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937184">It it interesting to me why people are against this. It is their lack of trust in the government to ever consider allowing it to do these things. We certainly saw that when the government chose to invoke an illegal use of the Emergencies Act. It instructed banks to freeze everyday Canadians' bank accounts because it did not like that they were supporting people who needed gas for their vehicles, food and, hopefully, to find a hotel if there was one left downtown that the government had not bought out so they could not sleep in a warm place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937185">The Liberals also called Canadians all kinds of names, which I would like to see them apologize for, calling us misogynist, racist, extremist. These are the reasons Canadians made the choices they made to stand up against this bill. They do not trust the Liberals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937186">Because of the pressure they and so many stakeholders have applied, we were able to force the Liberals to back down, split the bill and introduce Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>. The Privacy Commissioner confirmed that the Liberals did not even consult him when they were trying to grant themselves sweeping new powers to access Canadians' personal information from service providers, like banks and telecoms, without a warrant, although they kept saying there would be a warrant.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937187"> I am the member of Parliament for the wonderful people, who call the beautiful riding of Yorkton—Melville home, and as of October 15 this month, I have been here for a decade and have risen in this place to speak and intervene on their behalf. Over this tumultuous decade, the people of Canada, especially our younger generations, have become wary of the intentions of the Liberal government. It has tried, time after time, to usurp the rights and freedoms of Canadians, bully and divide, water down and destroy the very fabric of Canadian identity and quality of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937188">The government continues to show its true colours as it holds fast to its efforts to make Canada the first postnational state. It holds fast to ravaging our economy with roadblocks and walls that continue to deter private investment in everything from mining to manufacturing and agriculture. The Liberal government is responsible for what Canadians see today. There is poor border security because of the Liberals. There is continued unsustainable immigration because of the <Affiliation DbId="317577" Type="2">leader</Affiliation>. There is also an unprecedented financial burden of generational proportions it has orchestrated. All of this is impacting next generations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937189">This was all orchestrated by Justin Trudeau and the current <Affiliation DbId="317577" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who was the instigator as Trudeau’s economic adviser and as the guy ready to finish his art of the deal with values that leave wealth in his hands and nothing for Canada. The exhaustion, attrition, depression and hopelessness felt within our police services, our Canadian Armed Forces, our first responders and our medical professionals are off the charts. The simple reason, the indisputable answer, is that total violent crimes have increased by 50% since 2015 and through to 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937190">I feel like I should have a moment of silence after mentioning each of these violent crimes that are taking place in larger and larger numbers across our nation: homicide, gang-related killings, sexual assaults, firearm offences, extortion, auto theft, horrific violence against children, forced confinement, kidnapping, indecent and harassing communications, human trafficking, and we do not have the numbers yet for 2024-25. This is not the Canada that Canadians have grown up in, and it is not the Canada immigrants who took the proper paths expected to be part of when they came here.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8937191">This is in response to the government’s failed bail reforms and the removal of mandatory minimum sentences in Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="10620333" Type="3">C-5</Document>'s legalization of the possession of drugs and an open season for drug trafficking and fentanyl production in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937192"> Unfortunately, this bill is weak. It would make no commitments to enforcement, take no action on catch-and-release for those who traffic in fentanyl and firearms, and add no new mandatory prison times for fentanyl traffickers or for gangsters who use guns to commit crimes or who use our porous border to victimize Canadians. Instead of focusing on them, these Liberals are trying to confiscate legal gun owners' firearms, and they are having a bit of trouble accomplishing that, from what I understand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937193"> House arrest is still permissible for some of the most serious offences. Safe consumption sites still do not provide addicts with the encouragement and support to move to treatment, and the Liberals continue to put children in danger with no move to shut down fentanyl consumption sites that are near schools and day cares.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937194">I have to say that on this last part, I feel like I am living in that environment. I moved to Ottawa so that I could do my work, and the place I chose was in a good location. Then they introduced the legalization of drugs and put two safe consumption sites in that area, which is close to a school. Every morning now, as I walk to work, what I see on the streets has multiplied extensively, so this is not due to something that was in place before this happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937195"> There are people on the street who cannot stand up. They are bent over from the use of these drugs. They sleep on the grates to stay warm. They are sleeping in the little crannies between small businesses, and now there is a regular group that comes and picks up the garbage every morning. At 4 a.m., I am hearing the machines that come down the streets and the sidewalks to wash them, because one of the businesses that was there had to finally move, and it was one of the first in the city of Ottawa, because every morning, as I walk to work, they would be out with big pails of disinfectant cleaning the area in front of their business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937196">I hear more sirens from police and fire trucks every night, and there are nights when the loudness is so unbelievable, because it travels up through the buildings, that people cannot sleep. I am not blaming the people who are struggling. I am blaming the government for creating the environment that we have today that has added the violence that is taking place with firearms and attacks on people to this form of violence, which has basically caused multiple Canadians across this country to die from the use of fentanyl and caused their families to be in deep distress because of the condition of our country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8937217">After backing down from Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, the Liberals have now introduced Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>. Conservatives are examining the bill thoroughly to ensure that the Liberals do not try to sneak in measures that would breach law-abiding Canadians' privacy rights, as they tried to do in Bill C-2.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937218">Before I dive deeper into Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, I want to highlight two important topics of concern to the people of Calgary McKnight: the rising wave of crime in our country and the drug epidemic, which has claimed over 50,000 lives since 2016.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937219">Since 2015, crime in my hometown of Calgary has gone up by 58%. Firearm offences have gone up by 371%, and extortion has gone up by 353%. As I mentioned previously, the countrywide opioid epidemic has claimed tens of thousands of lives and represents a 200% annual increase since the government began its radical liberalisation of hard drugs. I heard one of my colleagues mention previously that the number of lives lost to drug overdoses in the last 10 year is higher than the number of Canadians who tragically lost their lives in the Second World War.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937220">Conservatives have been calling on the government for years to get serious about crime and to secure our borders. We have urged it to strengthen bail laws, crack down on the flow of dangerous drugs and stop illegal firearms from pouring into our communities. It is deeply disappointing that the Liberals acted on border security only after being told to do so by another country's president. It should not take pressure from a foreign leader for the Liberals to finally do what Canadians have been pleading for all along.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937221">Even in the Liberals' second attempt, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> still fails to address several critical issues. It does not include meaningful bail reform but allows the catch-and-release of individuals trafficking fentanyl and firearms. It would not introduce mandatory prison sentences for fentanyl traffickers who are fuelling the deadly opioid crisis. It would not implement new mandatory prison terms for gang members who use illegal firearms to commit violent crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937222">Despite the Liberals' tough rhetoric, it still seems that their priority is going after the guns of law-abiding hunters and intercepting the mail of ordinary Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8937223">Canadians deserve a justice system that protects victims and communities, not repeat violent offenders, but after a decade of the Liberal government's soft-on-crime approach, we now live in a country where violent criminals are released within hours of arrest, thanks to the Liberals' Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>. The Liberals repealed mandatory prison sentences for some of the most serious offences, like extortion with a firearm, weapons trafficking and importing illegal guns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937224">These are not small mistakes; these are deliberate policy choices that have emboldened criminals and eroded my constituents' confidence in the justice system. Conservatives believe in real consequences for repeat violent criminals and in sentencing that prioritizes the safety of Canadians over the comfort of offenders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937225">The product of the government's soft-on-crime legislation extends far beyond the courtroom. The fentanyl crisis reaches our streets, homes, hospitals and even children's playgrounds. The Liberal government's reckless policies have fuelled a nationwide drug crisis that has overwhelmed communities and left our brave first responders and health workers to clean up the mess. Meanwhile, the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="318692" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> refuses to rule out approving more drug injection sites next to schools and day cares, despite admitting that they are hot spots for fentanyl usage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937226">Some of the provisions in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> appear to be well intentioned. On paper, the legislation seeks to strengthen border security, crack down on gun smuggling and target organized crime networks and trafficking across our country. These are causes that all Canadians can support and that Conservatives have long been calling for. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937227"> The measures to inspect more cross-border cargo to tighten tracking of money laundering and to intercept the flow of fentanyl and hard drugs are steps in the right direction. If implemented correctly, these measures could help protect our communities from the violence and drug addiction that have taken root under the Liberal government's watch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937228">I look forward to the bill's being thoroughly scrutinized to ensure that it can deliver positive results without trampling on Canadians' rights.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8937244">Mr. Speaker, we are here to talk about Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>. I am going to focus my speech. As many of my colleagues in the House know, I do a lot of work with our first responders and our veterans. I do a lot of work dealing with mental health throughout our country, so I will be spending a majority of my time talking about fentanyl and how it has had just an incredible, devastating impact on our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937245">I would be remiss if I did not do this first. We have first responders all across our country who put their uniforms on every day to run into burning buildings, to run toward danger. Whether it is a nurse, a paramedic, a firefighter or a police officer, they are there to serve us and our families. They are there to make our communities safe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937246">One of my very good friends, somebody I deeply respect, Mr. Paul Hills, is in Ottawa today and has been here for the last week. I have worked tirelessly, shoulder to shoulder, with him to stand up for our first responders, who face threats of violence and violent acts each and every day. I am just honoured to call him a friend. I know that we are not allowed to acknowledge people in the gallery, so I will not look up to the gallery, but perhaps my colleagues could do me a favour and just provide a round of applause.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937247">He has worked tirelessly to get Bill <Document DbId="12177676" Type="4">C-321</Document> passed. The bill would change the Criminal Code to recognize, at the time of sentencing, that if the victim of violence is a health care worker, a nurse or a paramedic, that would be an aggravating factor in sentencing. He has been here working tirelessly with our Senate and with all of our colleagues on all sides. I send my heartfelt thanks to him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937248">Furthermore, I cannot speak to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, about strengthening our borders, if I do not recognize and talk about Brianna MacDonald, whom I have talked about in this House before. At 13 years of age, she lost her life in a homeless encampment due to an overdose. She turned 13 on my son's birthday last year, on July 15, and she was found deceased on my daughter's birthday, a month later, August 23, in Abbotsford in a homeless encampment. Her parents did everything to try to get her off the drug and get her off the streets. She was 13.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937249">We cannot talk about this bill or any bills when we are talking about strengthening our borders or making our communities safe without mentioning Brianna or Tyler Dunlap, or the nephew of our colleague, who mentioned her nephew passed away from an overdose. I lost my brother-in-law to an overdose. I lost my uncle to drugs. I have a brother on the streets now who is gripped with this crisis. I cannot leave that at the feet of the government because he has been on the streets for a long period of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937250">However, I ask those who are watching and those who are in the House today to take a look around our communities. Do they look the same as they did 10 years ago? The answer is no. There has been an increase in crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937251"> Fentanyl flows across our porous border. We are absolutely powerless to stop this drug from flowing across our border. That is why we are standing here to compel our colleagues, to plead with our colleagues across the way in the government, to protect our youth, strengthen our borders and ensure that law enforcement has the tools it needs to stop illicit drugs from reaching our communities. Right now, whatever we are doing, it is not working.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8937252">Over 50,000 Canadians have lost their lives since 2016. Those are just the numbers that we know. In my home province of British Columbia, overdose is the leading cause of death for youth ages 10 to 18. I say it in every speech because it bears repeating time and time again. Do members want to know what the second leading cause of death is? It is suicide. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937253">Our country is gripped in a mental health crisis and all we look at are band-aid solutions. That is not blaming the current government or previous governments; it is blaming us collectively as leaders, whether provincial, federal or municipal. We are failing Canadians. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> does nothing to affect that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937254">I was elected 10 years ago on Sunday. One of the first debates I undertook in the House was on the suicide epidemic in Attawapiskat First Nation. I remember listening to the debate and hearing some of our colleagues who had been in the House a lot longer than I had at that point say that their first debate, years earlier, was on the suicide crisis we had in Canada. We have done nothing; they are band-aid solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937255">Collectively, as a Parliament, we passed my motion to bring a three-digit national suicide hotline to Canada: 988. We did that in the last session. However, there is so much more we need to do. When we see Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> and bills like Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, an omnibus bill with much ado about nothing, we question why.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937256">Those who are new in the House, I remember being in the same seats as some of them in the back rows of both sides. I came here with great intentions and had great hopes for all, but we are failing. I cannot remember who said it, but one of our colleagues said that the time for talk is done; we need action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937257">Over seven and a half million Canadians are without a doctor. Our borders are broken and we are going to bring more immigrants into Canada, but they are not going to be able to get a doctor. They are not going to be able to afford food. They are not going to be able to afford a house or a roof over their heads. Where is the compassion in that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937258">Our police officers and first responders are taxed. How far are we falling when it is okay to firebomb an ambulance, to stab a paramedic or to knock a nurse out when they are just trying to help us, heal our broken bones or hold our hand as we take our last breath?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937259">I challenge all of our colleagues here. We get heated during question period, but when we talk about things that matter, like the mental health of Canadians, the health and wellness of Canadians, I think we could all agree that there is no health without mental health and that our addiction crisis is real. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> does nothing to stop the scourge of fentanyl, drugs or guns coming over our borders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937260">We can do better. The government needs to do better. The provinces are calling for it. The attorneys general are calling for it. The municipalities are calling for it. The police agencies are calling for it. I challenge all of us, but I challenge the government, because that is its legacy after 10 years. It says it is new, but it is the same old, same old. I know there are good people on that side, so I challenge them to speak up, those members, those colleagues, and to challenge the guy in the front desk to do better and be better.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8937279">Mr. Speaker, when we consider any bill, we need to ask a fundamental question: Who will this bill benefit? Will this measure that the government or the House is proposing make our programs more effective, make our services more compassionate and make our country fairer? When we look at Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C‑12</Document>, a bill that aims to strengthen our immigration system and our country's borders, I think that the answer is clear. It is a resounding yes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937280">This bill strikes a critical balance between a compassionate and a rigorous approach. It also strikes a balance between openness and security. It seeks to improve the way the government serves Canadians, newcomers and those seeking protection in our country, in Canada. It strengthens our security, supports our prosperity and enhances co-operation between the federal, provincial and territorial governments. In short, this reform is necessary. It is a compassionate and responsible reform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937281">Now I want to talk about the benefits for asylum seekers. The proposed measures will fundamentally modernize our immigration and refugee system. The aim is to better meet the country's needs while protecting the most vulnerable, those who seek refuge in Canada, often risking their lives to do so. These measures reflect a clear commitment to a sustainable immigration system, one that is rooted in compassion but that reflects our country's actual capacity to welcome, house and integrate newcomers. Canadians want our asylum system to remain a symbol of hope. They want a fair system that protects those fleeing war, persecution, hardship or climate hazards elsewhere in the world but that remains firm toward those who seek to abuse it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937282">Bill C‑12 creates a single online application process that is simpler, faster, more transparent and integrated. Thanks to better coordination between departments, cases will now be “decision-ready” when they are referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. The result will be fewer delays, less confusion and, above all, greater fairness.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937283">The bill also changes how late or irregular claims are handled, especially those filed more than a year after someone arrives in Canada. Asylum seekers will now have 14 days to submit their claim and will not be automatically sent back to the United States. These claims will be referred to a fair removal process that includes a pre-removal risk assessment. This will ease the pressure on our system while ensuring fairness and dignity in every case. By simplifying the process, we are making the system more compassionate, but we are also making it more efficient and effective. Behind every asylum claim, there is a face, a human being, a story, and, above all, hope.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937284">I will now address the issue of integration with the territories and provinces. An effective system also relies on collaboration, coordination and communication. Bill C‑12 promotes a closer partnership between the federal government, the provinces and the territories. It modernizes the communications framework to enable the rapid and secure exchange of information on immigration, citizenship and passport services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937285">Every day in my riding, Bourassa, I see how newcomers enrich our neighbourhoods. They contribute to our economy, our culture and our community vitality, including through their sporting achievements. I have spoken about this often here in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937286">By improving information sharing between Ottawa, the provinces and local organizations, we are sure to succeed. This strengthened partnership will make our system more effective, fairer and more compassionate, as I said earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937287">I will now talk about the public safety benefits. The safety of Canadians remains a top priority. We have seen human smugglers and criminal groups take advantage of irregular crossings to get around our system.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8937288">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> sends a clear message: Canada is still a welcoming country, but it is not naive. People who enter irregularly will have their cases dealt with through a fair removal process rather than by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. This measure protects the integrity of the system and strengthens public confidence. In short, these reforms ensure that our system remains both fair and secure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937289">I would like to conclude by saying that I believe in this bill and hope that everyone in the House shares the same view. If there is one thing I can say about this bill, it would be that the government is acting responsibly and trying to strike a balance. The most difficult part of making these decision is maintaining a balance between openness and constant vigilance. I would also say that this bill is a major step forward and that it makes our immigration system more modern, more consistent and more compassionate, while maintaining that balance. It strengthens public safety while maintaining the humanitarian tradition that Canada is so proud of.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937290">This bill reflects the vision of a Canada that is open, yet orderly; welcoming, yet vigilant; caring, yet responsible. That is the balance I was talking about. I am convinced that this bill will make our immigration system stronger and more deserving of Canadians' trust. I therefore ask my colleagues to support this important, balance-oriented legislation, and I thank them for their attention.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8937315">NAWL worked with me throughout the summer and early fall on crafting this legislation. I note that the government is calling for some amendments, which do seem reasonable to me, to maintain the integrity of the system while staying true to the main concepts of this law, as I have just outlined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937316">While I was working on this bill, I got so many calls from victims and survivors who wanted to share their stories with me that I could not find time to hear them all. There was one woman in Hamilton who was about to lose her child due to accusations of parental alienation, so I went to her house. I met with her and her nine-year-old daughter. They clearly had a loving relationship. They were both terrified that the police would show up to force her into the custody of her father, whom she did not know well, had never lived with and about whom she had disclosed a disturbing story that suggested sexual abuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937317">The transfer did not happen that night, but the next day when the mother and daughter were at the hospital dealing with anxiety, that is when it happened, and the mother wrote to me afterward. She said, “12 cops made me force her down seven floors, kicking and screaming, and told me I would be arrested in front of her if I did not take her to her father's truck. I can't make her last memory of me being physically forcing her into danger, and I also can't fight for her if I get arrested.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937318">This mother has not had any contact with her daughter for months upon months. She says that this bill would break the chains of our silenced children and set them free from abuse and slavery.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937319">Children's opinions cannot be left out of a divorce. They are part of the divorce. They should have a say. Canada ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991. Article 12 guarantees children the right to express their opinions on matters affecting them and emphasizes the need for them to have an opportunity to be heard in any judicial proceeding that affects them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937320"> Canada ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1981. That is monitored by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, also known as CEDAW. Last year CEDAW called on Canada to prevent the use of parental alienation allegations. They said in a news release, “Shelters, researchers, service providers, legal professionals, and experts all agree that parental alienation accusations are being weaponized against victims of domestic violence.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937321">Many survivors point to the 2023 report on violence against women and girls and its causes and consequences, by UN Special Rapporteur Reem Alsalem. She argued that all countries should adopt legislation to prohibit the use of parental alienation allegations in custody disputes. She said the following about parental alienation:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8937324">Let us look at what other countries are doing. In Brazil, parental alienation is actually a civil offence with potential criminal implications. The University of Manchester did a study that found that in Brazil, irrespective of abuse reported by mothers and children, fathers maintained direct contact with children. Multiple mothers lost custody and even all contact with their children. Five out of eight criminal investigations into child sex abuse, child rape and domestic violence by fathers were closed once there were parental alienation allegations. There has been so much controversy over the harms to women and children that this year, Brazil has a new bill to remove the concept of parental alienation from the country's laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937325">Spain is the opposite, with legislation that specifically prohibits accusations of parental alienation. Ireland this year vowed to follow Spain's example. In the U.K., family law prioritizes the best interests of the child, and allegations of domestic abuse take precedence over allegations of parental alienation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937326">In the U.S., responsibility falls to individual states. Arizona, California, Colorado, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Utah have all implemented President Biden's 2022 Keeping Children Safe from Family Violence Act, which prohibits remedies associated with parental alienation. Several U.S. cases have made the news, including a story last year in The Denver Gazette where a man facing criminal charges for repeatedly raping his three daughters got court-ordered reunification therapy while his wife went to jail for objecting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937327">Parental alienation was a concept developed in the late 1980s by psychiatrist Richard Gardner. He said at the time that it often involves malicious and false sexual-abuse allegations made by the mother against the father to gain sole custody and remove the father from their children's lives. It was all about fathers' rights, regardless of circumstances and regardless of abuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937328">The American Psychological Association says, “there have been no well-controlled empirical studies that confirm the phenomenon, nor have a standardized assessment process and specific diagnostic criteria been established for it.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937329"> The APA is concerned about this concept's influence in legal settings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937330">The remedies for parental alienation that the courts have been ordering have been found to be seriously damaging to children. Reunification therapy is also called reintegration therapy, multi-faceted family therapy, multi-modal family therapy, reconciliation therapy and therapy for the intractable resist/refuse dynamic. There is a proliferation of names used interchangeably, adding to the ambiguity and controversy of these approaches. Possibly most concerning is the lucrative nature of these therapies, causing an explosion of so-called experts. Last year, in the Family Law Quarterly, Chadwick and Sloan wrote:</ParaText>

To avoid human trafficking implications, guardianship of the child is transferred at each point in the operation. The children often do not consent to this treatment, which violates the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Canadian health care consent acts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937333">Other remedies to parental alienation are equally harmful, including forced contact with a parent estranged for good reason, immediate custody reversals, prohibition of contact between mother and child, police enforcement and cost orders against mothers deemed to be alienators. That is why this bill would do more than just ban allegations of parental alienation in family court.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937334">Witness after witness who appeared at the status of women committee last year disclosed how rampant parental alienation allegations are in Canadian courts. Abusers do not stop trying to control and dominate just because their partner has left; in many cases, the abuse gets worse. Carrie Leonetti, professor at University of Auckland law school, told committee that violent fathers are more than twice as likely to seek custody of their children after separation than non-abusive fathers. They are awarded custody approximately 70% of the time.</ParaText>

                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In the past two decades in family courts, the pendulum has swung from believing children and protecting them to disbelieving, silencing, and punishing their disclosures...re-entrenching fathers’ rights at the expense of women’s and children’s safety. The ideology of “parental alienation” has been the driving force behind this retrograde shift. </QuotePara>

              <ParaText id="8937337">She said that “parental alienation is gender bias masquerading as junk science” and that more than 90% of those accused are women and most of those are victims of intimate partner violence. She said, “Judges and psychologists are obsessed with the idea that, when children disclose abuse by fathers, resist being in their care, and ask for protection, it is their mothers who are the real problem.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937338">Now people in Canada are being told by professionals not to claim abuse or seek protection because it puts their child at further risk. We heard this at committee. The Ottawa Victim Services and the Elizabeth Fry Society of New Brunswick told us many victims feel “the price for leaving the violent environment is even higher than the price for staying at home”. Witnesses said reunification therapy was akin to forced reprogramming of children, often resulting in psychological trauma, not a healed family relationship.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937339">One researcher told us that children are silenced and that mothers are found to be “alienating” for normal reactions to abuse or normal behaviour such as not having pictures of their ex-partner in their house. Another warned that several U.S. providers of reunification therapy are moving into Canada because states are adopting child safety laws like the one I am presenting today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937340">One mother who was labelled an alienator told us, “Not one mode of contact is permitted. Imagine not even being able mail your child a birthday card or Christmas presents for years.... Children are not permitted to say last goodbyes or attend funerals.” Child survivors of the therapy told us, for example, “When we described emotionally abusive episodes, our dad told the therapist they didn't happen. The therapist told us that we needed to think of things from our dad's perspective, that we weren't remembering things correctly”. They were blamed for the abuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937341">A professor from the University of Calgary told us, “sometimes the people who are testifying as experts in parental alienation cases are the same people who run the reunification camps, and they stand to profit directly from those camps.” Another professor from Stockton University told us that a “cottage industry” of lawyers and mental health professionals who profit from parental alienation accusations in custody disputes often resist any limitations on the use of such claims. She said that this is done by people without particular training or qualifications, and that it is not a regulated industry; it is just very profitable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937342">I mentioned how much outreach I started receiving when I was working on this bill and since it has passed first reading, I can say that hundreds of organizations have indicated their enthusiastic support, like Women's Shelters Canada, the Alliance of Canadian Research Centres on Gender-Based Violence, YWCA Canada and dozens upon dozens of women's shelters across the country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937343">These are some quotes sent to me on social media. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937344">One person said, “This is so, so necessary. I couldn't stop weeping reading this bill. Our children must be heard and the court system must be transformed from being yet another tool for abusers to abuse, control, demean and devalue their victims.” Another person said, “This change cannot come soon enough. Anyone who is surviving the Family Court System learns quickly that 'children's rights' don't exist. They value parental equity above all. The term 'parental alienation' is thrown out by an abuser like a vengeful 'hail Mary'.” Another said, “You don't know me, but thank you so much. I am a sexual assault survivor and this Bill is going to change lives and protect so many kids from abuse.” The woman from Hamilton I mentioned earlier said, “My daughter was silenced and placed under the control of someone she explicitly said she feared. Bill C-223 gives children their voices back.”</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8937365">We all know, as members of Parliament, that our families are our bedrock, our biggest support system, our cheerleader at the best times and, let us be honest, our therapist at the worst times. Often, they are the reason we get into politics in the first place. I would not be here if it were not for the encouragement of my granddaughter. It is family that inspires me to tirelessly fight for a better Canada, not just for my family but for all families. I will always be a wife, a mother and a grandmother first and above all else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937366">Everybody in Canada deserves to have their loving family at their side and to experience a relationship based upon love, trust and mutual support, but unfortunately, many people have a different experience with family. Divorce has always been and will continue to be a difficult and trying time in our lives. It touches all of us in some way. We may have been impacted when we were kids or as adults in marriages of our own. Even if we are lucky enough to not have to face it ourselves, we witness it happening to our close friends or other important people in our lives. However, the facts are the facts: It does happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937367">When a divorce unfortunately does take place, the legislation here in Ottawa should be designed to protect people, especially children. I do not know my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="318067" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation>, very well, but I know she also cares deeply about families. I hope to work with her on this issue and other issues as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937368">However, rather than just talk about divorce after it has already happened, I think it is also important to address the root causes and systemic issues that lead to divorce in the first place. What causes divorce? It is well documented that stressful lives certainly do not help, and we all hear that life is certainly getting more stressful for people in this country, including in my community. The evidence is all around us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937369">It is hard to afford the necessities of life that we need, like food, housing and home heating. A full 25% of Canadians are now considered food-insecure. They are not asking for luxuries; they are asking for the basics, but the price of everything, including fruit, vegetables, meat and coffee, is going through the roof. The grocery aisle has become the luxury aisle. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937370">We just received new statistics about food inflation here in Canada: It is two times higher than the acceptable level that the Government of Canada has set as its own target. The government has to give itself a failing grade yet again. It is a fact that Canadian families are expected to spend $800 more in groceries this year than they did last year. This comes at time when half the people are only $500 away from insolvency, but they are paying $800 more for groceries. Members can do the math on that one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937371">What comes from that? Well, it means either cutting back or going into debt just to get the everyday essentials, and that is happening more and more. What can also happen? Divorce can. The stress of finances and empty stomachs can overwhelm relationships, stealing the joy of marriage and family. The average Canadian has credit card debt of nearly $5,000, and Equifax found that 1.4 million people in this country missed a payment last quarter. The hole just gets deeper and deeper. For every dollar that Canadians earn, they owe $1.74 in debt. We all know that this simply is not sustainable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937372">What can the government do to help eliminate financial distress, which is a large factor for many divorces? Bringing inflation under control is a big thing. We know what causes inflation; it is out-of-control government spending that drives up the cost of everything for Canadians. Instead of reining in the spending, the government is spending more money than even Justin Trudeau did. We have heard this story before, and we know how it ends: more people using food banks, more stress, more skipped meals and more burdens on families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937373">What else can we do to bring more financial stability to families and reduce the stress that places an extra burden on Canadians from coast to coast? How about providing stable, good-paying jobs that make people feel financially confident to get married, support a family, buy a home and get settled in a safe neighbourhood? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937374">People in my community are on edge more than ever. Each day, we see headlines about job losses and companies packing up and moving south. The news came out of Windsor, out of Oshawa and out of Ingersoll.

As unemployment goes up, divorce rates go up too. It is a proven statistical fact.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8937375">We are talking about divorce, but in order to get divorced, one has to be married in the first place. There was a time not that long ago when the only major expenses to worry about were the wedding ring, the dress and maybe the honeymoon. The weddings many dream of are now just fears of debts to be incurred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937376">With housing costs at record levels, doubled in just 10 years, and student loans that do not lead to good-paying jobs as promised, people do not even think about the cost that comes with raising kids of their own. The essential Canadian dream of growing up, getting married, buying a home and starting a family is becoming just that, a dream, an idea to be fantasized about but never actually achieved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937377">I knocked on thousands of doors in Cambridge and North Dumfries during the last election campaign. This was the number one issue by far that young people talked to me about. They are working harder than ever. They want to succeed. They are doing everything they were told to do, like getting a degree and cutting back on expenses, but still the dream never becomes a reality. How can it become a reality when they are forced to live in their parents' basement as a 30-year-old adult? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937378">For the lucky few who can get married, have kids and settle down, life is no less stressful. The days are busy with work, home and trying to match the energy of youth without feeling exhausted. Then add on the stress of paying for groceries and the mortgage. Just getting by is already heavy enough. Then throw on more Liberal failures, and the tension reaches a breaking point, ruining the marriages of many Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937379">There are times when both parents need to work, but they cannot because child care is unattainable and still unaffordable. Parliament's independent watchdog just released a scathing new report about child care in this country, saying it has led to endless waits, a shortage of spaces and a rationing of child care. The report found that less than half the required number of spaces have been created in the last three years, and we are nearly 70,000 spaces short of our target. Those are not just statistics on a sheet of paper; those are 70,000 families that cannot access the services they need and were promised by the government. However, they are still forced to pay higher taxes for something most do not receive. Financial stress keeps building, putting further tension on relationships. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937380">Marriage begins with vows that say “till death do us part”. Government failures that increase family struggles turns it to “till debt do us part”. These government failures drive up inflation and the cost of living. They drive down the rate of marriages and the growth of families. This all becomes a breaking point that drives up the rate of divorce, made even worse when divorce proceedings bring in the CRA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937381"> If I wanted to talk about things from Ottawa that cause people stress, I could keep going on, but I would be here all day. The fact remains the same: The government's policies are making life harder for people from all walks of life and making Canadian marriages harder. This has devastating consequences for our communities, for families of all types and, of course, for children, who often bear the brunt of it all. Our highest priority should be protecting children and standing up for them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937382">I look forward to studying this proposed legislation in greater detail and hearing testimony from witnesses at committee, but let us also make sure we try to tackle the causes of divorce before they happen: stress, uncertainty and strife. Let us give people the best shot at having long, happy, successful marriages. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937383">With all this talk of divorce, I want to say something on a lighter note. Marriage can come with a lot of obstacles that can lead to divorce, but it can also be something to be proud of. I thank my husband Bill for his endless support and all he does. I cannot think of anybody else I would rather have by my side. I thank my family, my children and my grandchildren for their understanding and continued love and support. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937384">I know we all feel the same way about our own families, and I know we want every single Canadian to have an opportunity for the same kind of happiness, love and support that marriage can bring. It is up to us here in Ottawa to bring in the policies that can make that happen. Let us bring back hope and the Canadian dream for everyone.</ParaText>

            <PersonSpeaking>
              <Affiliation DbId="318194" Type="2">Andréanne Larouche (Shefford, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8937385">Mr. Speaker, I am speaking this evening about Bill <Document DbId="13586181" Type="4">C‑223</Document>, an act to amend the Divorce Act. It is a delicate subject that requires great sensitivity. There are human tragedies behind this bill, as well as a lot of distress. I am very aware that this bill is a response to the study on the criminalization of coercive control that I proposed to the Standing Committee on the Status of Women.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937386">I will present the background and objectives of the bill. I know that this bill was important to the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="318067" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation>, with whom I worked at the Standing Committee on the Status of Women. It aims to amend the Divorce Act to better protect children and victims of family violence. Its key measures are the requirement for lawyers to assess the risk of violence before acting on a spouse's behalf; the possibility for the court to directly consult with children to find out their views; the prohibition on the court to take into account allegations of parental alienation, unless it occurs in the context of family violence; and a desire to avoid certain myths or stereotypes about violence ending after a separation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937387">I will elaborate further on the bill and speak to what is happening in Quebec. I will then present some statistics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937388">First, the intention is commendable, but it is a problematic legislative vehicle. The Bloc Québécois shares the goal of better protecting children and preventing domestic violence, of course. However, the bill goes too far in certain respects, particularly in seeking to dismiss the concept of parental alienation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937389">This approach risks weakening the tools available to courts to protect children in cases of parental manipulation. Parental alienation is a recognized concept. Despite what was said by some members of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women during the study on the criminalization of coercive control, parental alienation is not an ideological invention, but a psychological phenomenon observed and documented by research and practice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937390">According to a definition recognized by the Parental Alienation Study Group, parental alienation occurs when a child forms a strong alliance with one parent and rejects the other without valid reason. Experts such as Dr. Hubert Van Gijseghem and Jérôme Harrisson acknowledge the complexity of the diagnosis, but confirm its clinical reality. Alienating behaviours are not gender-specific. Both men and women can engage in them. Removing this notion amounts to denying the experiences of many parents and children in Quebec. In practice, courts already require solid evidence and professional assessments before recognizing a case of alienation. There is therefore no systemic abuse. I also know that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="318056" Type="2">Beauharnois—Salaberry—Soulanges—Huntingdon</Affiliation> will be able to talk about this a little later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937391">I would now like to discuss the risks of Bill C‑223. By removing all references to parental alienation, the bill prevents courts from examining a well-documented psychological reality, weakens the balance between parental rights and risks further judicializing family conflicts. This could leave some children without protection against manipulative behaviour. The 2021 legislation already provides a very comprehensive framework for family violence. Bill C‑223 therefore risks being redundant and unbalanced. Imposing a legal obligation to assess violence in every divorce case could also unnecessarily burden the courts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937392">Second, there truly is a Quebec perspective. Family law in Quebec is comprehensive and autonomous. Furthermore, family law falls under Quebec jurisdiction, except for divorce, which has been a federal jurisdiction since 1867. This distinction is anachronistic and unnecessarily complex. Quebec already has a strong civil law tradition, a modern and humane approach to family law as well as the unified family tribunal, which is new this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937393">What is the unified family tribunal? The justice minister, Simon Jolin-Barrette, created the unified family tribunal. Since October 10, 2025, civil union applications have been heard by the unified family tribunal, which is part of the Court of Quebec. The tribunal can hear and rule on various cases, which illustrates the Quebec government's expertise in and attention to this type of civil litigation. These courts can therefore already rule on all aspects of a separation, such as custody, alimony and parental authority—just not divorce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937394">The Bloc is calling for Quebec to have control over marriage and divorce so that there is a consistent system that is adapted to our reality. In addition, it would not be a two-tiered system.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8937395">We recognize that there are challenges. As I said earlier, we in the Bloc Québécois would have liked a study to be done on the issue of parental alienation. Instead, it was included in a different study, and even my colleague recognized earlier that we could have heard from experts on the subject. A study on the subject could have enhanced our discussions. We support the bill being sent to committee for further study. We are not throwing out the baby with the bathwater. We want to have experts, psychologists, legal experts and social workers come and testify. We want to propose amendments that genuinely protect children during acrimonious divorces and that guarantee their well-being without weakening family law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937396">However, we firmly reject the idea that parental alienation is an invention used by violent men. We are convinced that it is more complicated than that. We also reject the idea that the justice system is incapable of doing the right thing. Instead, the Bloc Québécois reaffirms its trust in Quebec courts and family professionals. We reiterate our commitment to defending genuine equality before the law, whatever people's gender. We also want to oppose any attempt to politicize psychology as it applies to legal proceedings. We want to do this work seriously in committee with other experts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937397">Third, I would like to present some useful statistics to inform the discussion about children exposed to their parents' separation or divorce. According to Statistics Canada, 18% of children aged 1 to 17 in Canada, or 1,185,700 children, have experienced their parents' separation or divorce. In Quebec, it was 23%. This illustrates the scale of the phenomenon and justifies the importance of a strong legislative framework to protect children. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937398">I will now present statistics on domestic violence, children, and family justice. According to police data from the Government of Canada, in 2019, 22,299 children and youth were victims of family violence. Of those children, 60% were girls. According to Statistics Canada, in 2015, 16% of victims of violent crimes were children and adolescents, and 30% of those crimes were committed by a family member.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937399">According to the Department of Justice, a review of court files revealed that domestic violence was mentioned in 8% of divorce cases. These data support the idea that domestic violence is prevalent in divorce and separation contexts and that assessing and taking this violence into account is justified.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937400">I am now going to share a few statistics on parental alienation and alienating behaviours. According to the Canadian child welfare research portal, one Quebec study involving 30 shelters found that 45% of accusations or threatened accusations of parental alienation over the one-year study period comprised almost all of the accusations made in the past five years, and that 86.7% of service providers said that this phenomenon was impacting their practice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937401">An online estimate showed that 11% to 15% of divorces in Canada involve significant parental alienation. According to the Canadian Equal Parenting Council, one study reported that the long-term effects of alienating behaviours include anxiety disorders, depression, personality disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder in adults. This shows that parental alienation is real, that it has serious consequences and that it cannot legitimately be excluded from all legislative debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937402">Regarding child custody after separation, according to the Department of Justice, court data revealed that in 62.2% of cases, the child resided primarily with the mother. In 9.4% of cases, the child resided with the father. In 21.3% of cases, the child was in shared custody 40% of the time or more. This helps illustrate the real environment of children after separation and supports the need for the court to have reliable tools, including for detecting alienation and deciding what is in the best interests of the child.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937403">In conclusion, Bill <Document DbId="13586181" Type="4">C‑223</Document> makes significant advances in terms of family safety. However, the fight against domestic violence must not be used as a pretext to gloss over legitimate psychological realities. The Bloc Québécois will act in a rigorous, open and cautious manner to protect children and prevent abuses. We firmly believe in this approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937404">In closing, I would like to reiterate that, in Quebec, family law must belong to Quebeckers.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="317943" Type="2">Hon. Karina Gould (Burlington, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8937405">Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin my remarks this evening by really thanking the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="318067" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation>. She has taken on this important private member's bill and taken on this important issue to protect children, to protect families and to protect parents. I cannot express my gratitude enough to her, but I think what is telling is that there are 300 women's organizations across this country that lend their support to this private member's bill. That is an indication of just how important this piece of legislation is to protect children in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937406">I want to share those thanks a bit broader because, as my Bloc colleague raised earlier, this began with a study at FEWO, at the status of women committee. It was also the courage of our members, from all parties, who began the study on coercive control and learned about the issue of parental alienation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937407">I want to take that a step back even, because this builds on important measures that the House has passed over the last years, notably the changes to the Divorce Act in Bill <Document DbId="9868788" Type="3">C-78</Document> and then, more recently, Keira's law. For those colleagues who do not know about Keira's law, it was the first time that judges would be required to study and understand intimate partner violence and coercive control. Keira's law came about because of a little girl in my community who died tragically while on a hike with her estranged father. Jennifer Kagan, her mother, believes strongly that if the judge had learned and understood about intimate partner violence, had learned and understood about coercive control, Keira, who was four years old at the time, would still be alive today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937408"> I want to thank someone else, Pam Damoff, who is no longer here in the House but who served as a former colleague. She really spearheaded this work and made sure that Keira's law became reality and that Keira's legacy would live on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937409">The member for <Affiliation DbId="318067" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation> is taking another step. I first became aware of this when a constituent of mine approached me to ask if we could have a meeting to talk about her situation. She shared with me that her children had recently been taken from her while she was going through divorce proceedings with a former abuser. When the spectre of intimate partner violence was raised, the judge interrupted and said it was parental alienation. What ended up happening was that she lost, entirely, the custody of her children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937410">What is really important here is recognizing that this is a phenomenon that is growing in Canada. When I spoke to my constituent about this, I was shocked because I thought the courts were there to protect people from these kinds of things. If someone is a survivor of domestic violence with the courage to leave, to speak up and to try to protect themselves and their children, the system is supposed to be there to support them. She thought the same thing. That is why she shared her story. That is why she was trying to leave and protect her children. Instead, she was punished for that. When we spoke about this, she said that she was not alone, and that she could get a call together of women across the country for whom this was happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937411">A couple of weeks later, I sat in on a Zoom call with over 50 women across the country who shared their stories with me. They talked about how their children had been taken from them by police, how their children were scared, how they were not able to have the kind of protection and support that they thought they were entitled to and they thought they would receive, and that they were in utter disbelief that this was happening. They told me stories like the one that the member for <Affiliation DbId="318067" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation> shared of children being taken across the border to receive reunification therapy, that they had no idea where their children were because they were not allowed to have contact with them and how desperate, alone and abandoned they felt by the system that was supposed to be there to protect them.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8937412">The bill would provide important measures to ensure that the rights of the child, the agency of the child and the well-being of the child are placed at the centre of divorce proceedings. That is something I think all of us, as parents, hope would be the case.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937413">I listened to my Conservative colleague's speech. The bill has nothing that is against the institution of marriage. The bill is trying to centre the rights of children in what is often a really awful situation for them, to give them a voice, to give them agency and to protect their well-being. What the bill would do is exactly that. It would clarify that there is no presumption of shared parenting, with each decision based on the best interests of the child.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937414">It would prevent the courts from blaming women who are victims of domestic violence for not actively working to improve their children's relationship with their abuser. It would stop the practice of disregarding children's views and preferences under the pretense that they have been manipulated or alienated by a parent. It would prevent judges from issuing orders that restrict parenting time with the parent to whom the child is bonded in order to improve the child's relationship with the other parent, and it would prohibit courts from forcing a child to attend reunification therapy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937415">As my colleague, the hon. member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="318067" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation>, said, it is not opposed to rebuilding relationships with parents. That is not what the bill is about. It is about ensuring that a child can make active decisions in what is going to happen to them and to their future. That is what we should be focused on in the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937416">I understand that the government has a number of amendments it wants to make. What we should be focused on in the House, and I implore and I encourage members from all parties in this, is that when we are studying the bill, we should always think about what the objective is. I hope the bill makes it to committee. The objective is to ensure the rights and the well-being of the children, who find themselves in a place that was not their decision and in a situation that was not of their making but that has a huge ramification and impact on their now and on their future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937417">When we speak to children who have gone through and who have been survivors of reunification therapy, as my colleague said, we find that some of it is fine, but some of it is really worrying. If we think about a child being sent across a border to be in some stranger's apartment and to receive some unprofessional therapy about what they think has happened and what the therapist is telling them has actually happened, we can imagine what that does to them. We can imagine the fear, uncertainty and loneliness they feel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937418"> I am asking the House to support the legislation. I think that what all of us want and what we care about is the well-being of the child. That is what we put front and centre here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937419">My colleague spoke about the fact that there is a cottage industry that is building up, a cottage industry that is preying on vulnerable children. The fact that there are judges who have decided that, when they hear a child mention potential abuse, their first instinct is to reverse custody, to take a child away from a parent and put them towards another one, is actually quite mind-boggling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937420">What we want is to have confidence in the courts. The bill would enable that. The bill would give us the confidence to know that the decisions being made about the now and the future of our children in situations beyond their control are being made in their best interest and that they have a voice and a vote in their future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937421">I thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="318067" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation> for bringing forward this important legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8937422">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill <Document DbId="13586181" Type="4">C-223</Document>, which was brought forward by the member for <Affiliation DbId="318067" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation>. I think everyone recognizes that the safety of our children and our grandchildren is paramount. My wife and I have four beautiful granddaughters, and I can attest that their parents would do anything within their means to protect them from danger, and my wife and I would stand there with them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937423">It is instinctive and natural to protect our young. We see it in the animal kingdom. There are bears that come into my backyard and neighbourhood regularly, and no one wants to face a mother bear with her cubs. This is true even with birds, which will protect their nest. It is natural for a society to want to protect its young people, and it is really important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937424">One thing Canadians from coast to coast agree on is that they have felt less safe and less protected over the past 10 years. Why do they feel less safe? It is because they actually are less safe. Do not take my word for it; look at Statistics Canada. Since the Liberals have come into power, violent crime is up 54%. Extortion has skyrocketed 330% across our nation and actually 582% in British Columbia.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937425">Sexual assaults have gone up 75%, and on the topic of children, sexual violations against children are up 249% in 10 years. People can go to the Statistics Canada website to see this. In British Columbia, for which I am a member of Parliament, it has gone up 400%. This is crazy, out of control and terrible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937426">There is no doubt that public safety under the Liberal government is a glaring failure. The streets Canadians walk on are less and less safe. The statistics I just mentioned, and anybody can look up those numbers, represent hundreds of thousands, even millions, of Canadians. These are not just numbers but are families, victims and children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937427">Auto thefts, break-ins and assaults are becoming increasingly regular occurrences. A few years ago I was talking with the agent of an insurance company who said that my neighbourhood was quite safe. I thought that was great, because it impacts insurance rates. In the past year or two, I have been surprised by how many of my neighbours have come to me wanting to see what my security cameras have shown, because of activities that have happened. Recently, and I was not able to get the car's licence plate number, there was a car parked outside with guys in it wearing masks over their faces. They committed a break-in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937428">This is the experience we are facing across our nation, and it is not good. Why has this been happening? It is because the Liberal government has systematically weakened our justice system. It has prioritized ideological policies over the safety of law-abiding citizens. It has eliminated mandatory jail time for serious offences and has effectively made it easier for repeat offenders to roam free, terrorizing communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937429">In Vancouver, the same 40 individuals were apprehended 5,000 times in one year, and that is just for the crimes they were caught for. I have talked to police officers who tell me how frustrating it is to arrest someone and to see them out later that day or the next day, roaming the streets again. They have asked, “What is the use?” It is not their fault at all. They are doing their job, but the legislation has made it so that they have to release criminals under the least onerous conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937430">The reckless Liberal approach has left families feeling vulnerable in their own neighbourhood and unsure if their home or their children are safe.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8937431">The Liberals' approach to justice is not just misguided; it is dangerous. lt puts the rights of criminals ahead of those of victims and communities, eroding trust in our institutions. Their bail, not jail policies have been like a bullhorn, blasting out to offenders that consequences are optional, that they can go ahead and roam our streets. If they want to steal or do this or that, it is a free-for-all. This is not the Canada I knew growing up, and it is not the Canada it should be right now.</ParaText>

That is important. I expect there will be more points of order. Why? It is because this is very uncomfortable. It is not a personal thing. I know different members over there, and I have respect for them as individuals, but I am talking about policies. I am talking about the direction the Liberal government has brought our nation in, and it is not good.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937437">When I was going door to door talking to thousands of people, I asked how crime has been over the past 10 years and where things were at. Nobody said it has gotten better. It has gotten worse, and Liberal policy is making it worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937438">I want to declare, unequivocally, my respect and admiration for our police forces. In my constituency, in Maple Ridge, Pitt Meadows and Mission, it is the RCMP. They work hard and do the very best they can to protect our communities under the legal framework they have. All Canadians owe them a debt of gratitude.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937439">In stark contrast to the Liberal record, the Conservative Party puts forward concrete and practical solutions that reflect the real needs of Canadians. We recently brought forward the jail, not bail legislation the Liberals voted against, even though police forces across the nation supported it. Last year, I brought forward Bill <Document DbId="13180878" Type="4">C-411</Document>, the anti-arson act, which would have brought in strong consequences for torching our forests and would have brought in mandatory minimums for those burning down places of worship. It seems like it is a free-for-all now to burn down churches or other places of worship under the Liberals. When I asked an OPQ, the government released that there were over 400 instances where places of worship experienced arson attacks. Deaths have occurred because of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937440">The Liberals do a lot of talking about criminal justice, but things have only gotten worse, and they are only going to get worse the way they are going.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937441">This week, on Monday, the Conservative member for <Affiliation DbId="317911" Type="2">Kamloops—Thompson—Nicola</Affiliation> introduced Bill <Document DbId="13584104" Type="4">C-255</Document>. This legislation represents a meaningful step toward protecting victims of intimate partner violence. It is practical and its solutions will make changes, but the Liberal government, with its habitual obstruction, has stalled and blocked common-sense reforms like the jail, not bail initiative, showing that it prefers photo-ops and hollow promises to real changes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937442">Canadians deserve more than symbolic gestures; they deserve a government that will fight aggressively for their interests by securing jobs in the auto sector, in forestry or anywhere else. They deserve a government that will make our communities safe again, not one that allows repeat violent offenders to walk free because of political ideology. The Conservatives will fight for a Canada where families can afford to live with hope and dignity, where they can feel safe in their communities and where they can put their trust in their government to be on their side, not working against them.</ParaText>

Families and victims are tired of waiting. Some are not here anymore because of what the Liberal government unleashed with Bill C-75. It is completely unacceptable for the Liberal government to tell families of victims of repeat offenders, such as that of Bailey McCourt, which we have heard about across Canada, that there is no need to dwell on the issue. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8937452">Mr. Speaker, the tragic death of Bailey McCourt shocked our communities and highlighted the urgent need to strengthen our justice system's response to domestic violence. Her life was cut short by an act of unparalleled brutality. I offer my deepest condolences to her loved ones. Today, we must honour her memory, but words are not enough. Concrete action must also be taken, and that is what this government intends to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937453">Intimate partner violence is a serious and unacceptable crime that invariably has profound and lasting consequences for victims, families and communities. Between 2011 and 2021, police reported 1,125 gender-related homicides of women and girls in Canada. Of these homicides, Statistics Canada determined that two-thirds, or 66%, were committed by an intimate partner. These figures are not just data. They represent lost lives, broken families and human tragedies that demand a strong, coordinated response. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937454">That is exactly why this government took action. As far back as 2019, through Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, the government strengthened bail provisions in cases of intimate partner violence. That legislation introduced a reverse onus at the bail stage for anyone accused of a violent offence against an intimate partner, particularly when the accused had previously been convicted of such an offence, in other words, when the accused is a repeat offender. It also required courts to consider prior convictions for intimate partner violence when determining whether the accused could be released and, if so, under what conditions. Finally, the law expanded the definition of intimate partner to include not only married and common-law spouses, but also dating partners. It is shameful that the Conservatives want to repeal that legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937455">Our government's efforts do not stop there. Today, the federal government tabled Bill <Document DbId="13679516" Type="3">C-14</Document>, the bail and sentencing reform act. This bill proposes sweeping reforms to make bail laws stricter and toughen sentencing laws for violent and repeat offenders. It is also designed to support law enforcement and invest in long-term prevention. These reforms are the outcome of extensive consultations with the provinces, territories and key stakeholders, including police departments, law societies and victim support organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937456">Bill C‑14 focuses on offenders who pose a serious danger to public safety. When an accused person is seeking bail, in certain situations, the onus will now be on them to prove that they do not pose a risk to the victim or to society. This is known as a reverse onus. It applies to certain offences where the accused choked, suffocated or strangled the victim.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937457">The police must deny release if it is contrary to the public interest or if detention is necessary to protect victims and witnesses. Courts will also have to take into account specific factors, such as whether the violence was random or unprovoked, and whether there are any outstanding charges. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8937467">I rose on June 9 to ask a question with respect to housing. I said, “In 2015, housing costs were an average of 38% of Canadian household budgets. Today, it is overwhelming. It is 52%.” This is a dramatic increase upward of over 20%. We are now sitting here in a housing crisis, which continues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937468"> The housing crisis, in some ways, has actually worsened, because we are now seeing people who are facing the renewal of their mortgages, and they cannot afford to stay in their houses. We are seeing an uptake in foreclosures and power of sales, and that has a devastating impact on many families across Canada. However, at the same time, we are seeing people lose equity in the value of their house. We have a problem that, really, only Liberals created. There are people who cannot afford to keep their house, people who cannot afford to buy a house and people who are seeing a decline in the value in their house all at the same time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937469">The heart of this issue comes down to some fundamental economic issues that have arisen over the last 10 years. We have seen an incredibly bad economy over the last 10 years. If members do not believe me, they can just ask the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. In his speech, he talked about how bad the economy has been managed over the last 10 years and how badly his party has done. It almost reads like a Monty Python skit with the former minister of industry now being the <Affiliation DbId="318631" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>. The one who helped direct us into this economic quagmire has been put in charge of the future, and somehow this is supposed to be a new government, a government that has woken up. I agree with some of the Prime Minister's criticism of the past 10 years, because there can be no doubt, what we need is a new direction where people can afford houses again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937470">I will run through a couple of the economic numbers in case people out there are unaware of just how challenging the economy has become over the last decade. We had the third-lowest growth in the OECD among 30 nations, dropping well below the OECD average. In fact, GDP per capita, which is simply the economic output per person, has dropped to almost 0% over the last 10 years. It has really been an economic lost decade, which has put Canadians in a position of earning less and things costing more. At the end of the day, it is not the amount of money we print, it is how many goods we produce and how efficiently. In Canada, we have seen a market loss relative to the rest of the world, which has created an economic nightmare where people are unable to afford the basic necessities of life, everything from food to housing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937471">Now, we have an entire generation that has nearly given up on the hope of owning a house. What is this <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s response? He says that we have to make sacrifices. Well, why does he not make some sacrifices? Why does he not donate the billions of dollars he has invested in Brookfield and other countries? Why does he not make some sacrifices instead of telling our young people, “Well, we know you can't afford houses, suck it.” This is his response to them. We need to do better.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8937474">Too many Canadians across the country are struggling with the high cost of housing, and the federal government is focused on solutions. We are starting to put money back into Canadians' pockets by reducing middle-class taxes and saving two-income families up to $840 a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937475">We are cutting the goods and services tax on new homes at or under $1 million for first-time homebuyers, delivering savings of up to $50,000. We are also lowering the GST on new homes between $1 million and $1.5 million. We have also made it easier for Canadians to save for their first home by raising the limit on the tax-free home savings account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937476">Young families and first-time homebuyers deserve the same opportunities to own a home that their parents had. Restrictive planning policies, rising municipal fees and insufficient support for housing at all levels of government have contributed to higher costs, construction delays and a lack of affordable housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937477">The Government of Canada is committed to lowering housing costs and restoring affordability. Since 2017, funding delivered through the national housing strategy has reduced or eliminated housing needs for more than 655,000 households. We have created or committed to more than 170,000 new housing units, but we know there is still more work to do, and we are not stopping there.</ParaText>

As the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has said, it is time to build. That means building housing at a scale and pace not seen in generations. That is exactly what we are going to do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8937487">Mr. Speaker, on Friday last week I asked a question regarding automated external defibrillators, AEDs as they are called. I asked about placing them in RCMP cruisers. I just want to talk for a while about some of the things that are hard to discuss in the 35 seconds allocated for a question in question period, in order to explain some of the benefits that would accrue from RCMP cruisers' having defibrillators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937488">The RCMP, of course, is the largest police force across Canada. It is the de facto provincial police force in every province except Ontario and Quebec, and even in Ontario and Quebec it has a limited presence, in national parks, the national capital region and so on. RCMP cruisers are not equipped with AEDs. By contrast, the City of Ottawa police, the City of Toronto police and the City of Kingston police, in the local area, have defibrillators.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937489">The City of Ottawa police have had defibrillators for over 20 years. In the case of the Toronto municipal police, the defibrillators were installed when the former <Affiliation DbId="317840" Type="2">minister of national defence</Affiliation> was the chief of police in Toronto. I spoke to him once about it. He said that he was very proud of the fact that he got them put in. He said that they have saved a lot of lives. Indeed they have.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937490">I, likewise, am responsible for putting defibrillators in a much smaller police force. The last independent police force in my constituency is in Smiths Falls, and I arranged the fundraising drive that allowed defibrillators to be placed in all its cruisers in 2005. In the cruisers of that small police force, they have been used on a number of occasions and have saved some lives, nowhere near the number of lives saved in Toronto because that has a very large police force.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937491">However, whether it is a small police force or a large one, the cops are frequently first responders. When an emergency call goes out, not just for a crime in progress but also for a health emergency, the paramedics are notified, the fire departments are notified and so are the police, and there is a bit of a lottery. Sometimes the police have the closest vehicle. Sometimes they arrive first.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937492"> If I talk to an experienced police officer, they will usually be able to say that they were the first person on site at some kind of cardiac emergency. If they are from the City of Ottawa police, the Toronto police, the Smiths Falls police or literally any of 100 other municipal police forces across Canada, they will be able to say they had an AED at their disposal and were able to attempt to save a life. It does not necessarily mean they saved it, but it might mean they did.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937493">The fact is that a significant number of lives are saved, and based on the save rate for various municipal police forces in Canada, we can take that and multiply it by the number of cruisers the RCMP has. If the RCMP had defibrillators, they would perform, on average, 300 saves every year. The cost to equip every police cruiser in the RCMP would be about $10 million. It would be a one-time cost, although the defibrillators have a finite life of about 10 years, and there is some upkeep, but it is minor.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937494">For $10 million, we could save 300 lives a year. There is literally no other measure I can think of that would save that number of lives for that small an expense. This is a government that is willing to spend many billions on other issues, to create a few jobs, for example. Saving 300 lives for $10 million is a bargain. Why does the government not take action on this?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8937495">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for Lanark—Frontenac for this very interesting, pertinent question. I thank him for the opportunity to speak to the topic of AEDs in RCMP vehicles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937496">While the RCMP's primary mandate is for the provision of law enforcement services, it is often called upon to support and fulfill broader first responder roles. The RCMP remains committed to doing so in its efforts to protect the safety of the public it serves, as well as its employees. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937497">This year, the Heart and Stroke Foundation indicated, “Each year in Canada, an estimated 60,000 cardiac arrests occur outside of a hospital.” The use of a life-saving measure, such as CPR or an AED, on an individual experiencing cardiac arrest doubles their chance of survival, according to both the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Heart and Stroke Foundation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937498">All RCMP officers are required to be trained and recertified in the use of AEDs, along with CPR and first aid certification, every three years. This important training and skills maintenance supports the broader first responder capabilities of the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937499">Public access to and installation of AEDs has become more prevalent across Canada in recent years, including in places such as sports and athletics facilities and recreation centres. This enables greater access to AEDs for use as a critical life-saving tool during cardiac emergencies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937500">While AEDs are not mandated by any federal legislation or regulation, the RCMP recognizes their benefit in specific locations and has adopted a limited AED program. AEDs have been approved for installation and use in certain facilities, including emergency medical response teams, some protective policing details, the divisional fitness and lifestyles program, and in provinces that require AEDs to be available per provincial policing standards.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937501">While the idea is interesting, it does need to be carefully considered, as a program such as this cannot be improvised. As the member for Lanark—Frontenac very well knows, RCMP are mainly deployed in rural areas where the response time is longer than in an urban setting. Therefore, the AEDs are less useful than in urban settings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937502">This just means that they need to be evaluated, and a national rollout would require consultation with partners, as well as an indepth needs analysis to determine what device is needed. As well, we need to look at varying operational parameters, including climate, temperature and durability, given the vastly different operating environments in which the RCMP provides policing services across the country. Sometimes in the far north, there are below zero or sub-zero temperatures. Finally, there would also be a requirement for an assessment of financial considerations, including additional costs required for the ongoing maintenance and replacement costs of the devices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937503">Although the RCMP's main responsibility is law enforcement, it frequently assists in broader first responder duties. In doing so, it maintains a commitment to protecting both its personnel and the public. Nevertheless, as far as a deployment of AED in every RCMP vehicle, it cannot be endorsed at this time. Such a program needs more study, including a careful evaluation of costs and benefits.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8937509">Mr. Speaker, currently, the RCMP provides contract policing services through police service agreements. The costs for RCMP services are shared between the provincial, territorial or municipal government, and the federal government. With the exception of Ontario and Quebec, RCMP contract policing services are provided to all other provinces and territories in Canada, as well as to approximately 150 municipalities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8937510">It is the RCMP's contract partners, the provinces, territories and municipalities, that establish the level of resourcing, budgets and policing priorities in their respective jurisdictions. Ultimately, decisions made by the government of local jurisdiction can impact the RCMP's ability to allocate funding for the purchase of new equipment. The scale and financial impact of procuring AEDs for the RCMP would need to be assessed, and may eventually be assessed, in consultation with contract partners to determine the extent to which these devices could be deployed.</ParaText>
