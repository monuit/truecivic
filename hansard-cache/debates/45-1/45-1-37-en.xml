              <ParaText id="8905794">The petitioners are deeply concerned about proposed regulatory changes to Canada's Plant Breeders' Rights Act. They note that the act currently grants plant breeders exclusive rights for 20 years, but it also protects farmers through a farmers' privilege clause, which allows them to save and replant seed from their own harvest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905795">The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is proposing to remove this privilege for fruits and vegetables, ornamental and hybrid varieties. The petitioners warn that this would force farmers to purchase seed annually, drive up production costs, restrict access to new varieties and undermine the ability of farmers to adapt to climate change. They argue that this change would unfairly erode the age-old practice of using farm-saved seed and that Canada should strengthen public plant breeding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905796">The petitioners call on the government to abandon these proposed changes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8905799">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support my colleague from Courtenay—Alberni this morning by tabling a paper petition along the same lines.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905800">The petitioners are very concerned about the changes to the plant breeders' rights regulations. The proposals put forward by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency aim to prevent farmers from exercising their age-old right to use the products of their land to reseed in future years, which would force them to pay extremely high fees to use seeds every year. A pattern seems to be forming here, and people are telling us they are concerned about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905801">We want to protect the autonomy of agricultural producers, ensure our food resilience and, above all, ensure that the cost of agricultural production does not increase too quickly. The government has gone off on the wrong track with regulations. People are worried, and they are telling us so. I therefore formally ask the government members to consider this petition. It is very important. I thank the people who started the petition, as well as my colleague from Courtenay—Alberni.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8905813">She said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to move this motion. I will be splitting my time with my friend from <Affiliation DbId="318006" Type="2">Calgary Crowfoot</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905814">I am going to start with a sidebar and give a hometown shout-out that stretches right across the country, a big hype for the Toronto Blue Jays, which took down the Yankees last night and lifted the whole country with them. Canada's team is flying to the ALCS, and as a big fan, this team gives me all of the feels. I know that is true for everyone across the country. I congratulate them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905815">Unfortunately, members are not going to like the next part. Just like the Jays proving what teamwork and discipline can do on the field, imagine what Canada could achieve if the government showed the same focus. Unlike the scoreboard at the Rogers Centre, which we have been seeing go up and up, the only numbers going up in Ottawa, unfortunately, are deficits, unemployment and net investment flowing southbound rather than here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905816">I am going to tell a story, or, rather, a cautionary tale. Once upon a time in the not-so-distant past, in the year 2015, a trust-fund millionaire living in Liberal la-la land decided to run a radical experiment. He decided to spend billions of dollars of people's money to figure out whether budgets could truly balance themselves. Never mind that anybody with a background in finance or accounting or any part of the real world told him that it was not possible, Justin Trudeau was not going to be deterred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905817">According to the Trudeau school of economics, proudly located at the university of unicorns and fairy dust in a land of make-believe, spending ourselves deep into the red, lighting endless amounts of taxpayer money on fire and calling it “investment in spending” somehow makes us all richer. Ten years and hundreds of billions of dollars later, the most expensive and costly experiment in Canadian history has ended, and everyone with even an iota of common sense could have predicted what would happen. We did not get the promised utopia where everybody gets a job, nobody has to work and nobody thinks about monetary policy. Instead, the Liberals doubled the debt to give us higher inflation, higher taxes and smaller paycheques.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905818">That is true today. Our living standard, as measured by economists, has stagnated and is getting worse. Rather than creating more prosperity, we lost half a billion dollars in foreign investment, investment per worker dropped by 10.8% and our labour productivity sunk. All the while, he said anybody who questioned any of this was talking down Canada and called them racist and alarmist, saying the planet would burn down. He called them every name in the book just for calling out the facts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905819">When Canadians were finally freed of the high-tax, high-spend Justin Trudeau regime earlier this year, they breathed a short sigh of relief because the new guy was supposed to be different and better. He said he was an economist who knew how markets worked. He said he would cut back on reckless spending and make it easier to create investment here in Canada. He said that he would do things differently. He said that he would get a trade deal with the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905820">Here is where we are. First of all, he kept the old people from the old government: the <Affiliation DbId="318631" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="322412" Type="4">trade minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="318701" Type="96">jobs minister</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="318629" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="319063" Type="96">justice minister</Affiliation>. Most of those on the front bench are the same, so it is not really a new government. Instead of fighting for Canada and keeping elbows up, the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> brought a calculator to a knife fight, as his minister said he would. He is adding up on that calculator a $1-trillion gift to Donald Trump, subtracting 86,000 jobs here in Canada and multiplying American tariffs on our goods by two.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905821">The <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is not spending less; he is spending more. Justin Trudeau was the most expensive prime minister in Canadian history. It was forecast this year that the Liberals would spend $42 billion. The Parliamentary Budget Officer said the new Prime Minister is going to spend 60% more, and that amount is only growing. Somehow the new Prime Minister has found a way to spend more than the guy who spent more than all of the other prime ministers combined. For those watching at home, spending $26 billion more means making the deficit bigger, not smaller. It means less money in their pockets. The <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is hoping that they do not notice that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8905822">Liberals are telling Canadians again, just like they told them in 2015, that money is an investment and is supposed to create more jobs. This is how it adds up: We lost $54 billion of net investment in just half a year, which went southbound, not here; 86,000 jobs are gone; and we have the fastest-shrinking economy in the G7 with the second-highest unemployment rate, instead of the strongest economy in the G7 like the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> stood at every podium during the election and promised.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905823">These are not stats. They are connected to people's lives, families and paycheques. Every job loss in a place like Windsor, Oshawa or Ingersoll means that another family is not sure how they are going to put food on the table. It means a father is not sure how he is going to tell his kids their dad does not have work anymore. Every person who wants to work and cannot find a job does not have the dignity that comes with being employed. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905824">These are the real stories of the effects of these big numbers. Every time somebody who is working one, two or even three jobs goes to the grocery store and cannot afford basic necessities, it is the failure of the principle that if someone works hard in this country they should be able to get ahead.

However, if that comes from a paycheque, they are being sold out in this scheme. That is why it is so infuriating to see the Prime Minister and the Liberal government doing the exact opposite of what they said they were going to do. It is especially galling that, after the Prime Minister went to Canadians in a time of crisis and offered them his word and hope, he then completely forgot about everything he said on the campaign trail. Worse, he possibly did not mean any of it at all.</ParaText>

Someone who has been listening to the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> might have heard a bunch of talk about operational budget versus capital budget.

              <ParaText id="8905828">Why are the Liberals doing this? If we want to know the reason they are doing this, it is simple. They cannot stop the spending but want to brag about balancing a budget without doing that. If they are trying to do that, they are just changing the way they count. This is what we are seeing from the Liberals. It is like someone claiming they ran a marathon, but they quietly moved the finish line 20 metres up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905829">None of this is fiscal responsibility; it is all financial theatre. We are going to see that on November 4.

They are not going to be able to hide it for much longer, because the fiscal watchdog says that we are “at the precipice” of a cliff. That means the government is spending more money than we can spend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905830">More debt and more interest payments equal higher taxes, higher inflation, fewer jobs for Canadians and less money spent on the very things we need it spent on in this country, like services for Canadians.

              <ParaText id="8905848">Mr. Speaker, it is $100 billion. No, that is not Dr. Evil's ransom demand from the world. That is today's headline in the National Post. The potential deficit that will be tabled in the budget in November is $100 billion. This is today's front page headline. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905849">It is important to consider how we got here. A $100-billion deficit is staggering. This is almost twice the national transfer to provinces for health care. This is the amount of extra borrowing being piled on. The interest from that will eventually make us unable to spend money on health care, national defence and all the things Canadians rely on from their governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905850">How did we get here? The government, in 2015, promised it would run limited deficits for three years. It was the only party in that election promising to do so. Even the NDP back then knew we could not borrow with impunity forever. The Liberal Party was the only party promising a deficit. It said that deficits were okay. This was going to be a short-term deficit. It was going to make historic investments in national infrastructure. It was going to make investments. Its deficits were investments, and that would lead to the budget balancing itself and make people more prosperous. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905851">Here we are, 10 years later. We have an out-of-control structural deficit closing in on $100 billion annually.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905852">When the Liberals were elected, this promise of limited deficits followed by a balanced budget was immediately discarded. It was never, ever acknowledged after that. Bill Morneau was the finance minister. I attended question period after question period. In the finance committee, there were appearances by that minister. He never acknowledged this solemn promise that, clearly, was a point of differentiation between parties. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905853">That was part of what got the government elected in the first place, and it was a lie. What the Liberals had promised during the election was so obviously untrue compared to what they did in office. They were elected. They passed a bunch of anti-business, anti-job and anti-industry bills like Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document>. These led to immediate capital flight from Canada. Upon the election of the government, $200 billion from the energy industry alone left this country. Half a trillion dollars of investment has left Canada since the government was elected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905854">We are here today to call on the government to quit plagiarizing the playbook that has brought us to the point we are today. These out-of-control, structural deficits began under the Liberal government. It inherited a balanced budget. This is clear. A balanced budget was tabled in 2015. The fiscal monitors who track spending showed that we were on track to balance it until the new spending of the Liberal government was brought in. It received a balanced budget. It inherited one. It blew it immediately. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905855">The capital flight that resulted from the Liberals' out-of-control spending and anti-industry laws kicked in immediately and began to do what these policies always do everywhere they have been tried from time to time: They led to inflation. We have out-of-control deficits. We have inflation. We have a cost of living crisis now. We have the worst-performing economy in the G7 right now. The Liberals always talk about the G7 and say we are going to be the best in the G7. Well, we are the worst. Our economy is no longer growing per capita. In fact, it has shrunk. It is lower per capita than it was in 2014, the final year of the Harper government. Per capita GDP is lower now than it was in 2014. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905856">Let us think about that. This means Canadians are getting poorer over time. I do not even think a 10-year window covering the Depression would even reveal a period that long and that sustained of declining per capita GDP, or GDP that has shrunk.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8905857">We have lower wages, lost jobs and lost investment under the government. We call upon it to reverse course and get serious about the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905858">That brings us to the current <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. As has been remarked by others, this was the guy who was supposed to know what to do. It had been 10 years of Trudeau, and we were done. We needed to actually have a serious person and have an adult in the room. They switched leaders, and this guy who was supposed to be the adult in the room, who knew finance and had a wonderful resume, came in. He said that this was a serious point of crisis, that we are going to get serious, that we are going to rein in spending and get control of the public finances so that we can grow the economy and deal with the current challenges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905859">What has happened since then?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905860">He did not do any of that. This is a <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who promised Canadians that they were going to rein in the general bloat of government that has occurred under the Liberals. The size of the public sector in Canada is the only thing that grew under the government. They added 100,000 federal public servants, yet service gets no better for Canadians. They cannot run anything over there. There are 59,000 employees at the Canada Revenue Agency, and they still cannot answer the phone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905861">The government was supposed to have someone serious at the helm now, someone who would get control of our finances and bring the budget under control. It has not happened. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905862">Liberals promised, in the election, to rein in and reduce the expenditures on consultants. In the first estimates that they tabled, they have gone from, I believe, $19 billion to $26 billion. I do not have it in front of me. That is what I recall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905863">They have increased their spending on consultants. They told Canadians that they were going to rein this in, that this was the whole point of the change of leadership, that there was a change of style.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905864">They keep talking about a new government, even though it is the same front bench and there have been the same policies over the last 10 years. It has not happened.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905865">We are getting close to a new budget. I might add that, on top of the $500 billion in capital flight that has occurred under the government before the current <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> arrived, it has accelerated since then. Another $60 billion has left the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905866">When investment dollars leave the country, that means there is no investment in plant and equipment and technology, which would help drive up productivity so that Canadians can earn more and live better, fuller lives and cope with the increased costs that have crept in under the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905867">It is not happening. Wages are not rising. Unemployment is rising, with 900 jobs lost in my city last week in one layoff, announced by Imperial Oil.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905868">These guys have spent the last 10 years chasing investment and jobs out of, especially, the energy sector. We call on them to fulfill the promise that they made in the election and start getting serious, finally, about the budget. We have had a PBO report and a PBO committee appearance, in the last couple of weeks, that are just devastating.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905869">The Parliamentary Budget Officer has said that the government's fiscal plan is unsustainable. He called it “stupefying”. He said that it is “unsustainable”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905870">The Liberals always claim these different measurements, such as declining debt-to-GDP ratio. When the debt-to-GDP ratio started to come up, it was our AAA credit rating. We will see them bait and switch every time on their goalposts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905871">That credit rating is at risk. They are trying to trick Canadians with a new accounting methodology as their deficits continue to get even worse.</ParaText>

The fact is, every time there has been a surplus in Canada, particularly under Paul Martin, the savings came from cutting transfers to the provinces, nowhere else. That is my first point. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905886">My second point involves my Conservative friend, whom I would like to congratulate on his speech. I agree with him. The Liberals' management of public finances is a disaster, and it has been for a very long time. Oil subsidies are one of the reasons for that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905887"> Would my Conservative colleagues agree with me that sound fiscal management would require the government to stop handing out subsidies to oil companies?</ParaText>

From time to time, we hear its members patting themselves on the back over the Trans Mountain pipeline. They congratulate themselves for nationalizing what was private infrastructure and subsidizing it to a staggering sum, so we ended up using public money to build something that should have been built privately. It would have been built privately if the government did not chase the investment out of Canada.</ParaText>

There were many circumstances. We had the Trump tariffs and trade issues. We had issues surrounding crime and safety in our communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905913">Canadians actually did a comparison. I believe, from when I was knocking on doors, that the people of Canada were looking at the background of those leaders. What they saw in the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">leader of the Liberal Party</Affiliation> was someone who was a former governor of the Bank of Canada, a former governor of the Bank of England, an economist and someone who understands the economy.

I have been a politician virtually just as long, maybe even a bit longer than he has. It is an honourable profession.

              <ParaText id="8905921"> Let us look at the types of things done, coming out of the last election, by the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government, whether it was getting rid of the carbon tax, something that was initiated virtually when the Prime Minister became the Leader of the Liberal Party, or the first substantial pieces of legislation brought in after the election, Bill <Document DbId="13539746" Type="3">C-4</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="13547622" Type="3">C-5</Document>. Bill <Document DbId="13539746" Type="3">C-4</Document> gave 22 million Canadians a tax break.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905922"> We also then brought in Bill <Document DbId="13547622" Type="3">C-5</Document> to build one Canadian economy. On this side of the House, within the Liberal caucus, there is a build Canada strong mentality. We are determined to make Canada the strongest economy in the G7, contrary to what the Conservatives say day after day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905923">We can look at some of the very basic, fundamental stats. Let us take a look at the labour force participation and contrast it to that of the United States. Canada's labour force participation is far greater than it is in the United States. That does not mean we are not sympathetic to people who are losing jobs; of course we are. That is the reason we have developed five major projects, with more to come before the Grey Cup game.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905924"> Of course we are sensitive to the people who are losing jobs, just like we are concerned with the issue of affordability. Let us look at the reality of affordability, year over year. From July to July, inflation was 1.9%. That is well within the markers set up by the Governor of the Bank of Canada. That is why interest rates have gone down. That is why we are in the lower half. We are also doing better than most countries in the G7 on interest rates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905925">The Conservatives talk about debt. We have the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio in the entire G7, and the Conservatives know that. They know some of the economic indicators. However, they still go around saying that things are so bad in Canada, and then they criticize the Liberals if we try to portray things in a little more of a positive light, accusing us of trying to pat ourselves on the back. We are expressing the reality of the situation: Canadians of all political stripes outside the chamber are coming together and working together to build one strong Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905926"> We have a <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who went to the United States of America to meet with President Trump to begin negotiations in a very tangible way so we can be there for Canadians. What did the Conservatives say? They said that they want the agreement and that we had said we would have an agreement, and so on. They will just fold, capitulate and do whatever they want. We are not going to do that. We believe we have to be there and get the best deal for Canadians. If that means we have to wait an extra week, two weeks or a month or two, whatever it takes, we are going to achieve the best deal for Canadians. That is what the negotiations are all about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905927">On building our economy, let us take a look at the projects we have brought forward: LNG in B.C., copper in the prairie provinces, nuclear energy in Ontario, the port in Quebec, and a very aggressive, proactive Atlantic caucus pushing on a number of different projects, just like in Manitoba where we are trying to get into the second round of major projects. Premiers of different political stripes and Canadians of all stripes are working together in order to recognize that these types of investments mean something: $60 billion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8905934">Mr. Speaker, the Liberals are always bragging about all kinds of things and throwing numbers around. They are saying that they have lowered interest rates and curbed the massive inflation we have been experiencing in recent years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905935">However, the reality for Quebec and Canadian families is that prices are still very high. After the pandemic, prices did not go back down, but wages also did not go up. That means that groceries now cost a fortune and so do housing and social activities. Everything costs a fortune, but purchasing power did not adjust to inflation following the pandemic. That is what the government should do. That is what it should be focusing on.</ParaText>

We do care very much about what is taking place in our communities. The issue of disposable income is something that we take very seriously, and that is why the Prime Minister actually got rid of the carbon tax. That is why we gave the tax cut for 22 million Canadians. That is all increasing the disposable income for Canadians. The Prime Minister, in a very short window, has already demonstrated compassion and a caring attitude in providing supports for Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8905938">Mr. Speaker, what I always find quite amusing is how Conservatives take an economic issue, completely dumb it down and try to explain things that in reality are not practical. I remember, a year ago, the countless number of times we heard the <Affiliation DbId="322132" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> say that the only thing that caused inflation was the carbon tax and that as soon as the carbon tax was gone all inflation problems would be gone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905939">Of course, the Conservatives neglect to reflect on the fact that inflation is a global phenomenon that is impacted by so many different events. What the parliamentary secretary did today was highlight a lot of the dumbing-down of economic issues, which, quite frankly, is probably why the Canadian people do not put faith in the Conservatives when it comes to the economy. I wonder whether the parliamentary secretary would agree with me on that?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8905943">Of course, today's debate is on an opposition day motion. My Conservative colleagues will know that I always enjoy the opportunity to engage with the text of the motion they put before the House. The text of today's motion tries to suggest that Canada's new government is similar to the last one. There are elements where that is true, and there are elements where that is wrong.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8905945">
                <B>Hon. Kody Blois:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hear some of the Conservative members yelling and jostling across the aisle. They would love to think the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> we have now is the same as the last prime minister, and they are trying to paint that picture in the House, but Canadians know that is not the case. I will highlight in my speech the differentiation between how the government is keeping policies we think are extremely important and how it is also making substantive changes that Canadians asked for and that we have a mandate to help deliver in the current Parliament.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905946">I also want to reject the premise that the Conservatives are putting forward, the idea that any form of deficit somehow does not lead to investment or is somehow problematic for the economy, and I think we are going to have the opportunity to tackle that as well, but let us take a look at the government's record in the past. I look forward to highlighting this to my Conservative colleagues who voted against a number of measures that, I want my constituents to understand, the party opposite has been against.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905947">There is the national child care policy. We talked about it for 50 years. It is helping deliver affordability for families. It has increased access to child care across this country. Is that a failed policy? The Conservative Party would suggest that national child care is a failed policy of the last government. The current government believes in it. We are working with provincial and territorial governments across this country, and I know it is making a difference. There is more work to be done, of course, but it is not a failed policy. I think parents, women's advocates and people who believe in youth and childhood development are not going to tell us it is a failed policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905948">What about the Canada child benefit? It is helping to ensure that in Kings—Hants, $17 million a month is provided to lower-income and middle-income families. I have had opportunities to talk to single mothers who have said to me that without the Canada child benefit, they would not have been able to put their child in organized sports or that they would perhaps not be able to buy more nutritious groceries.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8905950">
                <B>Hon. Kody Blois:</B> Mr. Speaker, Conservatives again are yelling. The member for <Affiliation DbId="317589" Type="2">Yorkton—Melville</Affiliation> is suggesting that she supported it. No, she did not. I am happy to go on the record to say that they voted against that policy. Is it a failed policy? I think not. The Canada child benefit is one of the best policies the government has put forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905951">There is the old age security and the guaranteed income supplement. There are a lot of seniors in Kings—Hants. Those seniors matter. I try to be an advocate. We have to be a lot of different things to a lot of different people as members of Parliament, but I have tried to be an advocate for our seniors. I ask my Conservative colleagues, is that a failed policy of the government, the increase of 10% to OAS for seniors and the augmentation of the guaranteed income supplement? They voted against it. I guess they can explain why they did not think it was important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905952">There has been generational infrastructure investment in Kings—Hants, whether in waste water or infrastructure to support housing. There has been a housing boom in our communities. I would ask the Conservatives this: Is the investment under the Canada infrastructure program a failed policy? I would suggest it is not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905953">Income with respect to heating is important. In Atlantic Canada, the government has put forward programs that would actually help everyone below the provincial median income with up to $20,000 to help move towards a heat pump and give people above the median income access to borrowing and to making investments to improve energy efficiency. This is most important for affordability, but it also reduces emissions at the same time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905954">Conservatives voted against the heat pump programs every single time. I guess that is another failed policy, yet I have seen the results in my own riding with respect to what it has meant for individuals who have been able to transition off a heating source that was costing $7,000 or $8,000 a year to heat their home, and it brought their energy bills lower. I guess the Conservatives suggest that it is failed policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905955">I believe, and I would hope members of the House agree, that fiscal discipline is an important public policy measure. It matters. On that, I would extend an olive branch to MPs who want to talk reasonably and rationally about it, but to suggest that any deficit does not or cannot lead to economic success is a complete fallacy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8905956"> Let me give an example Canadians at home would appreciate. I cannot speak for every member in the House, but I can talk about the time when my wife and I bought our first house, and we did not have the money to pay for it. We ran a deficit. We took a mortgage. We borrowed to try to create a better future. I know that we have work to do on housing across the country, but many Canadians would be able to relate to a similar situation when they borrowed to try to build a better future. Governments are no different. Governments have to make choices about whether they want to make investments to create a better economic outcome.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905957">As opposed to looking at this through a binary choice suggesting that any deficit is a bad thing, as opposed to looking at the investments to grow the economy, a better measure is the debt-to-GDP ratio. If we are running a deficit, is the economic growth outpacing the debt that is being taken on? </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905958">I am happy to tell my Conservative colleagues that Canada has the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7. What does that mean? The economic growth is in proportion to the size of the economy. This is important, because I do not hear a whole lot of intellectual stuff coming from you guys in terms of the economic basis, I am sorry to say.

              <ParaText id="8905962">Mr. Speaker, I listened when colleagues spoke, although I certainly disagreed with a lot of different measures. The net debt-to-GDP ratio is the size of the Canadian economy versus the debt that exists. My measure for Canadians at home then is to say that Canada's debt position is actually sustainable. We have to be able to look at the cost. That is exactly what the government is doing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905963"> It is interesting to hear the Conservatives yelling again in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905964">The budget has not yet been presented. The government was elected on a mandate very clearly to do two things, to separate operational spending versus capital investment. The government is going to be doing that. We have signalled that we are going to be, frankly, reevaluating operational spending while also setting aside the capital investments to build a future for a brighter tomorrow. That is extremely important.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905965">The Conservatives stand up in this place to tell Canadians that, frankly, there is no economic hope, that the country is broken, and we have heard that same narrative. Canadians want politicians to talk reasonably about the challenges that exist. I will be extremely clear: The government understands that it has a mandate to rein in operational spending, while at the same time, to invest in capital projects that are important.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8905969">We also have the lowest deficit in the G7. We would never hear that from the opposition benches in terms of our position. I think it is important that the government actually addresses operational spending. It is coming on November 4. We are going to see that from the government. It is going to be a responsible approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905970">What I am hearing from the Conservatives is that they would just gut everything. They would gut it all. Canadians do not want that. They want a government that is going to walk the line between a reasonable fiscal approach, reining in operational spending, at the same time being forward looking about where the economy has to go, because we are in a difficult period. The world is a different place than it was six months ago. The U.S. government is changing its trade policy, which is having an adverse impact on certain sectors in the Canadian economy. The government was elected, and the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was elected, to make sure that we are the best ones to move forward in terms of how Canada positions itself in the days ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905971">I think it is extremely important when we talk about what this government is doing, such as major projects. The Conservatives, I would hope, would be in support of that. LNG too, when fully completed, will be the second-largest LNG project in the world, and the lowest emitting. That is something we should be proud of. As to the Foran mine in Saskatchewan, we should be proud of the copper production there. In our neck of the woods in Atlantic Canada, it could be renewable energy that we could drive forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905972">We have cut taxes for 22 million Canadians. We have removed the GST for first-time homebuyers up to $1 million. We have removed the consumer carbon price, which again, was important for rural communities. It is a strong policy that I was advocating for. I am glad to see that the government and the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> have been able to find a pragmatic way forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905973">The last thing I am going to say is that the Conservative motion talks about food prices. It is pretty rich to have members of the Conservative Party stand up here in the House on this. They had nothing to say in the election for farmers, not one single message.

Individuals who are making millions of dollars do not need $100 a month from the government to be able to support their children. For lower- and middle-income individuals across the country, including those in Kings—Hants, the government has tailored that policy. It was a key change from the Conservative policy and platform. We have also augmented the amount that goes out to families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905992">I can tell the member that families in Kings—Hants understand and know the difference between the Canada child benefit and what the Conservatives had on offer in a previous government. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8905993">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="317810" Type="2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905994">First, I would like to go back to the discussions we just had. Quebec receives equalization payments. We always forget that when a Quebecker buys gas that comes from Alberta, Alberta receives royalties from the oil companies. At some point, we need to set aside the myth surrounding equalization payments and acknowledge that subsidizing the oil industry not only exacerbates the climate crisis, it financially benefits people who are already raking in record profits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905995">We have repeatedly heard our government colleagues celebrate the low inflation rates Canada has had in recent months. Incidentally, this supposed return to normal last August, when inflation sat at roughly 1.9%, enabled the Bank of Canada to lower its key interest rate to 2.5%. Let us take a moment to think about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905996">We on this side of the House quickly realized that when the Liberals brag about Canada's low inflation, they are actually celebrating low growth. There is a bit of bad news buried in what may seem like good news. Prices have stopped rising excessively only because they are already far too high. The fact is, this stagnation shows how little spending power Quebec and Canadian families have right now. In other words, it means our constituents do not have enough money in their pockets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905997">The numbers speak for themselves. With almost zero growth, or just 1%, the GDP per capita will go down this year, and probably next year, too. The government can say what it wants. While Canada is not technically in a recession, the people certainly feel like they are in one. It is not complicated. Prices that are already too high are staying that way, and although they have stopped skyrocketing, people are getting poorer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905998">Even worse, the steepest rise has been in the price of basic necessities, particularly the cost of rent and food. All across Quebec and Canada, household debt levels have skyrocketed. Unfortunately, the lowest income earners are the hardest hit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8905999">As we know, the federal government is bloated, inflexible, costly, and often dysfunctional, and that is because it is out of touch with the reality of families, workers and communities. All too often, the federal government creates poorly designed programs that miss the mark. In its desire to standardize and centralize everything, the federal government forgets that each region has its own needs, its own unique features and its own priorities. The result: instead of solving problems, Ottawa's involvement nearly always makes them worse. Recent examples are self-explanatory and speak clearly to the situation we are in today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906000">This was notably the case with the international student file during the last session, when the <Affiliation DbId="300022" Type="4">Minister of Immigration</Affiliation> at the time restricted access to post-graduate work permits for students who completed certain programs. At the same time, the federal government announced an across-the-board measure to address challenges specific to Ontario. This was a red flag for many stakeholders, who said that this change could adversely impact them, and that parts of Quebec, in particular, might suffer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906001">What this decision confirmed was that, as usual, before implementing these measures, the minister and his colleagues did not consult anyone directly involved on the ground or the institutions that were going to be impacted by the measures. For Liberals, the word “consultation” usually seems to mean hiring more consultants. They forget to consult the actual stakeholders, the ones who are on the ground and who are affected by all these measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906002">Turning back to the matter of international students, it soon became clear that the citizenship and immigration minister's response was totally improvised. Worse still is the fact that the federal government did not even seem to know what was going on. I observed this myself in committee: The officials present were not familiar with Quebec's education system and its differences. The answers I received in committee were mind-blowing. The officials were unable to tell me what a CEGEP is. This is quite astonishing. People wonder why we want to make Quebec its own country. This was a blatant example of the lack of understanding of Quebec's unique differences that exists in the rest of Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8906003">That is unfortunate, because too many of this government's decisions over the past few years have sent that same signal. It was then as it is now. The government still has no coherent plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906004">Let us return to today's topic. The Bloc Québécois does not agree with every statement in the Conservative Party's motion, but we will vote in favour of it anyway. The federal government's mismanagement and the recurring deficits it is generating are a serious problem that we need to find solutions for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906005">The entire preamble of the Conservative motion is true. People are experiencing high levels of financial anxiety, and middle-income households are suffering the most. It is also true that inflation is currently under control and has dropped below 2%, which led the Bank of Canada to lower its interest rates by 25 basis points last week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906006">However, it would be false to say that the families everyone here represents are better off financially. That picture is misleading. Families' two most basic expenses, housing and food, are far too high.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906007">We absolutely have to protect the most vulnerable people. The lower a person's income, the greater the proportion of that income they have to spend on food. It is basic math.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906008">Meanwhile, here are two examples of transfers to individuals that would help the most vulnerable people cope with rising food prices, for which the federal government is to blame. First is employment insurance. The reform we have been waiting for, which has been promised since 2015, is still not on the table. This would make a big difference, especially in the current economic climate. We also have old age security, of course. Pensioners and seniors, the people who built the society we have today, are in a tough spot. These seniors are now facing very challenging situations, and that is unacceptable. Each and every one of us has a duty to fix this. This issue should be above partisanship, as the majority of federal members who supported the previous bill introduced by my colleague from Shefford understood.<Affiliation DbId="318194" Type="2" /></ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906009">Earlier, I heard the Liberal member say that that the Bloc Québécois wanted more spending. We we are proposing is targeted spending. Liberal members voted for the bill introduced by the member for Shefford to increase OAS for seniors aged 65 to 74 to address this inequity. They did that. What I heard earlier is that they were going back on their word. Once again, they are failing the most vulnerable people and that is unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906010">What is also unacceptable is the $83 billion in oil subsidies that I mentioned earlier. We have to stop that. This industry does not need money. It is making record profits and, moreover, it is contributing to the climate crisis in a very negative way. That also costs taxpayers money. Meanwhile, the government is going to build a pipeline that will cost a fortune, which cost 10 times more than it was supposed to. The private sector did not even want to build it. Given its spending and current fiscal management, this country is heading straight for a wall.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906011">The member for Shefford also had a great proposal that would allow pensioners who wish to re-enter the workforce to be less impacted at tax time. This is targeted spending but, ultimately, it is actual investment that helps retired people make more money and put more food on their own tables. This would also be good for their mental health and physical health. It would help businesses and facilitate the transfer of expertise from this generation to a younger generation entering the workforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906012">There are plenty of things that can be done to save money, but subsidizing the oil industry at the expense of the seniors and retirees who built the society we live in is certainly not one of them. We will gladly vote with the Conservatives, because the current government is doing a very poor job of managing public finances. The way it is acting right now is intolerable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906013">I get the impression that the Liberals are forgetting that it was the public that decided to give them a minority. At some point, they are going to have to get that into their heads.</ParaText>

Ultimately, after all the discussions we have here, which can sometimes be a bit heated, we are getting back to the basics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906038">What matters most is understanding the government's role. What role should the government play in the current economic environment? The Conservatives have an opinion, a perspective, on that role. They believe it should be minimal. The government should do nothing. It should cut taxes as much as possible and let the economy decide what happens. We have a very different view of the government's role. It is a different concept because the environment today is very different from what it has been for the last 15, 20 or 30 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906039">Let us look at what has happened, especially over the past 10 years. Our colleagues keep going on about inflation, deficits, and this, that and the other. However, there are a few things to keep in mind. There was a pandemic. In 2020, the global economy came to a standstill. It was not pleasant, and the governments of all the OECD countries and the world were at a bit of a loss as to how to get out of this situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906040">We did end up getting out of the situation. However, the global economic recovery was hampered by supply chain disruptions, which caused inflation. The inflation stems from that period, from the disruptions to global production. We had a heavily integrated global economy that disintegrated somewhat with the pandemic. When demand rebounded after the pandemic, prices rose because there was not enough supply. Everyone wanted to buy the same thing at the same time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906041">Just as we were beginning to recover, what happened? The war in Ukraine started and energy prices soared. It was not the Liberal government's policies that caused energy prices to rise around the world. Give me a break. Ukraine was also a major grain producer. Global grain prices also rose. Then, just as we were starting to recover a little, what happened? A new American president took office and told everyone on the planet that his favourite word is “tariffs”.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8906042">The new U.S. administration's goal was to opt out of the global trading system. The Canadian economy, which is highly integrated with that of the U.S., has suffered and continues to suffer a great deal as a result of these issues. Since the partners we have been counting on for decades are no longer reliable, we need to change directions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906043">The government has a role to play in that. Right now, the Government of Canada is taking responsibility. We want to help the Canadian economy transform itself, diversify and seek out new markets. That is the direction that November's budget will take.</ParaText>

I have heard many great things about the hon. member who just spoke, but surely he would know what happens to the money supply when the Bank of Canada purchases the debt that the government issues. While there is no money printer printing physical bills, the money supply increases substantially, which is, in effect, like printing money.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906078">This is an important time for the country. We know there are a number of threats economically. It is not an easy task to deal with them, but we have seen this movie before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906079">The former prime minister, Trudeau, said that he would spend just a bit of extra money and have small deficits to get big economic gains. What did we have? We had a decade of very poor economic performance, $100 billion of deficits before we hit COVID and multiple hundreds of billions of dollars of deficits during COVID.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906080">We had multiple commentators, including the Bank of Canada and well-known economists, telling the government that its spending was contributing to inflation. The Bank of Canada went so far as to ask why we care about inflation so much. It is because it hurts low-income and vulnerable Canadians the most. That is why we should care about inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906081">Do we know who benefits from inflation? The government and people who own assets benefit from inflation. Government revenues have never been higher. They exploded during the inflationary environment, and the government could not help but spend all of that money and more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906082">In 2015, before the government took over 10 years ago, the federal government spent about $300 billion on its expenditures. That number today is expected to be $530 billion for the fiscal year that just ended. That is a substantial increase in spending, yet the Liberals are still so far away from balancing the budget. We are not even in a recession. What is going to happen to the federal fiscal finances if, heaven forbid, a recession takes place?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906083">The Parliamentary Budget Officer has warned that government finances are “unsustainable”. For example, in 2015, the federal government spent 7.5¢ out of every expense dollar to pay interest on the debt. Today, that number is over 10¢, and it is expected to go to 14¢ out of every dollar in just a few years. In real dollar value, $80 billion a year will be paid in interest on the debt in just a few short year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906084">Why is that the case? It is because the government took on too much debt in the first place. It is not just that. It is that when the government took on the debt, it did so absolutely negligently, borrowing in all short-term debt. We had countries during COVID, like Austria, issue 100-year bonds. The average term to maturity in Mexico is 18 years. In Canada, the average term to maturity is six. Heck, even the provincial government in Ontario is 12 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906085">What the government has done to the management of this nation's finances is nothing short of embarrassing. We will be doubling the amount the government spends on interest on the debt in a decade. That means less money for social services. The IMF, which members of the government love to tout as a wonderful multilateral institution, has already acknowledged that for every single penny that is spent on interest on the debt, a corresponding amount is cut from social services.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8906086"> That is why we care about spending. The individuals in this chamber and the individuals outside who were warning that the government was spending too much a few short years ago were laughed out of the room because our debt-to-GDP ratio was falling or we were not spending that much on interest on the debt. Now look at where we are, and this is before we are even in a recession.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906087">In May, the Bank of Canada warned that 40% of the government's debt issuance is purchased by hedge funds. Why should we care about that? It means that 40% of the debt issued by the government is purchased by financial speculators, who do not hold the debt for very long. They buy it and sell it immediately in the repo market. What is going to happen to our interest rates if something outside of Canada, such as a sovereign debt issue, a crisis somewhere else or global economic uncertainty, causes these hedge funds and financial speculators to not have liquidity or not be able sell the debt they purchase? Who is going to buy the debt then?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906088">Yields will increase, interest on the debt will increase and social services will have to be cut. Of course, we could get back to the central Bank of Canada purchasing the debt of this nation and monetizing the debt, which is, in effect, printing money. What happens when we print money? Inflation goes up and a massive gap is created between those who hold assets and those who do not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906089">For all of the government's focus on low-income individuals, its absolute blindness to and not recognizing the negative effects of inflation on low-income and vulnerable Canadians is deplorable. The government has overseen an increase of wealth and income disparity in this country over the last 10 years. Over the previous Harper administration, it went down. Wealth and income disparity did not go up under the previous Conservative government. They have gone up under the Liberal government in the last 10 years, because its policies and inflationary deficits have made those who hold assets richer and those who do not poorer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906090"> That is what happens. This is simple economics. It is not what I would have expected from a well-regarded, well-renowned <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who has all of these accolades and says he knows better than everyone else. He did not run on spending double what Mr. Trudeau spent in terms of deficits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906091"> Other Liberal policies are leading to inflation everywhere. It is not just food. Let us think about insurance costs. Because the government has made this country uninvestable, reinsurers have left it. That means there is less competition in insurance, which is why rates for commercial and auto insurance are going through the roof. This is in addition to the fact that the government does not seem to care, or has only recently seemed to care, about stolen cars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906092">I was at my favourite watering hole last night, called Stolen Goods. What a wonderful place. People there were telling me they spend about one-third of their equivalent rent payments just to ensure they have commercial insurance for their enterprise. This is unsustainable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906093"> These economic policies and outcomes are a direct result of the government's lack of focus on the economy, believing it can solve every problem by spending more money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906094">The <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> just went down to the Oval Office. I would be embarrassed if I was a Liberal MP sitting here today. The Prime Minister campaigned and said that Conservatives would kneel before the altar of Mr. Trump, but what did he do? Here are a couple of headlines. “It’s humiliating to kowtow to Trump. But what choice does Carney have?” That is in the Globe and Mail. Althia Raj writes, in the Toronto Star, that the Prime Minister and Donald Trump “put on a show of affection”. She even called it a “bromance”. I think it is reasonable to point that out.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906110">Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin my speech this morning with a movie review, if I may. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, is widely considered to be James Cameron's masterpiece, won 11 Oscars and brought in $2 billion at the box office. Of course, I am talking about <I>Titanic</I>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906111">One of the most memorable scenes from that movie is when the ship is first coming up on the iceberg and the lookout yells, “Iceberg, right ahead!” All of a sudden, the captain and crew spring into action, reverse the engines and turn the wheel and rudder as hard as they can to try to save the ship from hitting the iceberg. Unfortunately, it is too late. The ship crashes into the iceberg and sinks to the bottom of the ocean.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906112">Historians have long agreed that if the lookout had seen the iceberg just a few seconds earlier, the ship could have turned in time and the disaster could have been avoided. Imagine for a minute if, instead of seeing the iceberg only one minute or two minutes before the crash, they had seen the iceberg 10 years in advance. How would events have turned out differently? It would not have made for a very good movie. If the lookout could have seen the iceberg from miles and miles away, it would have been pretty easy, presumably, to avoid crashing into it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906113">Ten years is how much warning the Liberal government has had about the dangers of Justin Trudeau's reckless spending and the continuation of those reckless policies under the current <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for the past six months. However, it was not always like this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906114"> A generation ago, the Chrétien-Martin Liberals were the party of fiscal responsibility. Former finance minister Paul Martin once said the Liberal government would balance the budget “come hell or high water.” Tough choices were made in the 1990s, but eventually, the books were balanced, because the government understood that a nation cannot spend its way into prosperity with money it does not have. Conservatives may have disagreed with some of the decisions that were made along the way, but on the core principle of fiscal responsibility, there was support from both parties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906115"> Unfortunately, in more recent times, Justin Trudeau said the budget would balance itself. In 2015, he said the Liberals would run three small deficits for three short years and then the budget would be balanced. Fast-forward to December 2024, when the Liberals were to present their fall economic statement. By that time, their deficit had ballooned to the figure of $62 billion, an amount so embarrassing that the finance minister chose to resign that morning instead of facing the embarrassment that would inevitably come with a deficit so massive and out of control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906116">That raises the question of how much the deficit is in 2025. Sadly, no one knows, because the Liberal government has until this point procrastinated, postponed and delayed the tabling of a budget and has continued to sail full steam ahead as though nothing was the matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906117">We got a glimpse of it recently from the Parliamentary Budget Officer when he testified before the government operations and estimates committee. He described the government's finances as “unsustainable”. He went on to say:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906118">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> It's not a funny fiscal outlook. It's a really serious fiscal outlook. We don't lightly use the word “unsustainable”. Unsustainable means you don't have the option of saying, “Maybe I'll wait a couple of years and see how things go.” It means, if you don't change, this is done.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906119">The Parliamentary Budget Officer might as well have stood up and yelled, “Iceberg, right ahead!”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906120">The Liberal government needs to change course before it crashes the ship into the iceberg, but unfortunately, the current captain of the ship is continuing on the same course Justin Trudeau had us on. We are already seeing the harms caused to our economy and our standard of living.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906121">In 2015, the Liberals said that their deficit spending would lead to investment, but 10 years later, investment per worker has fallen by 10%. The burden of debts and deficits on our economy over the last 10 years has caused us to have the worst per capita economic growth rate in the G7. Under the current <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s watch, since he took office earlier this year, 86,000 net jobs have been lost, leaving Canada with the second-highest unemployment rate in the G7.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906122">Food inflation has doubled. In fact, in a recent report from Food Banks Canada, the government received a failing grade when it comes to food insecurity, down from a C grade just two years ago.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906123">Since the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took over six months ago, $54 billion in net investment has left the country. Without investments in new factory equipment, new farm machinery and new businesses, the productivity of the Canadian worker and the standard of living of Canadians will continue to decline.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906124">Another unfortunate thing about the Liberals' massive, out-of-control deficit is that the number has gotten so big that it is difficult for people to understand just how big it is. When the price we pay at the grocery store, gas pump or a favourite restaurant goes up, we understand right away how much money that is. This is because people make these purchases all the time and notice when a tank of gas or a favourite meal costs more than before. However, when we are talking about the size of the federal deficit, the number is so huge that it almost becomes meaningless to ordinary people. That is especially true when the Liberals refuse to table a budget and hide how much the deficit actually is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906125">For argument's sake, let us take the $62-billion deficit from last December's fall economic statement. How much is $62 billion? How big does that amount of money look?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906126">The largest-denomination bank note issued by the Bank of Canada is the $100 bill. If someone were to go down to the bank, go to the ATM and withdraw $62 billion in $100 bills, it would be 620 million $100 bills. Each $100 bill is about 0.1 millimetres thick, which means that if we were to stack those 620 million $100 bills one on top of the other, the stack would reach 62 kilometres high. Put another way, that is about seven times the height of Mount Everest. If we were to use $10 bills, we would have 70 Mount Everests. Using rolls of toonies, there would be enough toonies to wrap around the entire planet. If the rolls were loonies, there would be enough loonies to wrap around the entire planet twice.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906127">Fortunately, pennies have been taken out of circulation, so I will stop my analogies there, but I hope I have made my point about the enormity of this economic iceberg Canada is sailing into. The Liberal <I>Titanic</I> may have gotten a new captain last winter, but the course that was charted 10 years ago under Justin Trudeau has not changed. We are still sailing straight into an Everest-sized economic iceberg. It is time to change course.</ParaText>

The goalposts were to balance the budget “come hell or high water”. A few years later, the Liberals said they were not going to balance the budget, but it would be a function of GDP. They would keep it under a certain percentage of GDP. Now they are talking about separating the deficits between operational deficits and fixed assets, or whatever the term is.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906149">I am very pleased to participate in today's debate. Our government is well aware of the fact that many Canadians are struggling to make ends meet. They have a lot of bills to play, housing is expensive and it costs a lot to buy groceries to feed their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906150">However, this is something that is happening around the world. We understand this reality and we are looking at all the issues. That is why we are proposing many measures to help Canadians keep more money in their pockets. </ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8906151">Canada's new government is focused on delivering a plan to address the cost of living challenges impacting Canadians across the country. That is what we are interested in, not cherry-picking data. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906152">Let me give a few examples.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906153">Very early on, the government delivered a middle-class tax cut to allow hard-working Canadians to keep more money in their pockets. Nearly 22 million Canadians are already benefiting from our middle-class tax cut. This tax cut will save two-income families up to $840 in 2026. Going forward, it is expected to deliver over $27 billion in tax savings to Canadians over the next five years. This rate reduction will benefit Canadians across the country. The bulk of the middle-class tax cut will go to those with incomes in the two lowest tax brackets, including nearly half to those in the first bracket of $57,375 and below in 2025.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906154">With this middle-class tax cut, the lowest marginal personal income tax rate was reduced from 15% to 14% effective July 1. Now this tax cut is helping hard-working Canadians keep more of their paycheques to spend where it matters most.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8906155">Our government is also well aware that there is a housing crisis in Canada. Although we have seen improvements recently in some cities, too many Canadians, especially young people, are having a hard time finding housing that they can afford. That is why our government is implementing an ambitious new approach to increase Canada's housing supply.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8906156">For example, the government is moving forward to eliminate the goods and services tax for first-time homebuyers of new homes at or under $1 million and to reduce the GST for first-time homebuyers of new homes between $1 million and $1.5 million. We need the support of the budget to do that. We are talking about significant support, as first-time homebuyers can save up to $50,000. Altogether, it is expected that this tax cut will deliver $3.9 billion in savings to Canadians over five years. With this targeted support measure, the government is allowing more young Canadians to enter the housing market and, by doing so, realizing the dream of home ownership. Through this GST relief, we are ensuring that first-time homebuyers have lower upfront housing costs and more money in their pockets for related expenses. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906157">In addition, there are a number of measures to increase the supply of housing. I am delighted to note that this GST relief will also have a dynamic effect on increasing supply, spurring the construction of new homes across the country.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8906158">Our commitment to helping build more homes from coast to coast to coast does not stop there. We recently launched Build Canada Homes, a brand new federal agency tasked with building affordable housing at scale. This is wonderful, and it has been too long in coming.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906159">Build Canada Homes will quickly build affordable, prefabricated housing on federal land. The agency will also help fight homelessness by building supportive and transitional housing in collaboration with provinces, territories, municipalities, and indigenous communities. In my riding of Guelph, we have had great success in recent years in creating essential supports to combat homelessness, and we need to see much more of this across Canada. This program will help maintain very affordable community housing for low-income households. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906160">In short, Build Canada Homes will accelerate housing construction and give private builders the certainty they need to build even more homes. With Build Canada Homes, our government is transforming public-private partnership. The program has been very well received by everyone in the sector. Our approach is to use modern construction methods while fostering the emergence of a whole new Canadian housing industry.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906161">The government also cancelled the consumer carbon price to refocus carbon pricing on large emitters. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906162">In Guelph, the child care support program this year saw daily child care costs reduce from $35 to $22 per day. That means thousands of dollars in savings for people who have children in child care. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906163">With all of these measures, the government is delivering lower taxes, bringing down costs, putting money back in the pockets of Canadians and supporting them through a number of initiatives like trades retraining and investing in industries that are struggling right now, in order to make sure we keep those jobs. However, it is important to understand that to continue supporting Canadians, we need to manage Canada's fiscal finances carefully. When I was on a city council, I brought in value-for-money audits and went line by line through the budgets. I really care about this. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906164">We on this side of the House are guided by fiscal discipline. We will spend less and invest more. We are going to balance the government's operating spending with revenues over the next three years by cutting waste, capping the public service, ending duplication and deploying technology to improve public sector productivity. The <Affiliation DbId="318631" Type="4">Minister of Finance and National Revenue</Affiliation> will deliver the details of the new government's plan on November 4 by presenting budget 2025 in the House.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8906190">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to today's Conservative motion. This is kind of an emotional moment for me, because, for once, we will finally be able to vote in favour of a Conservative motion. It is not too populist and it contains pretty accurate information. It also contains some very important statements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906191">I will not reread the entire motion because that has been done several times today. However, I will read my favourite sentence, and I would like members of the House to pay attention and to take a moment to think about what it means: “[E]very dollar the government spends comes out of the pockets of Canadians”, Quebeckers and citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906192">I deliberately paused for a moment so that members could think about that. That sentence still applies when the government gives contracts to its friends, to two or three guys working out of a basement whose only job is to get government contracts and then subcontract them out while keeping a cut for themselves. Everyone know what I was talking about there. Every dollar spent comes out of citizens' pockets. When we talk about the cost of groceries or the cost of housing and members are pointing fingers at everyone else, the fact remains that the citizens are the ones who bear these costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906193"> I see members here in the House of Commons voting against minimum indexing, not even decent indexing, for old age pensions starting at age 65. However, groceries are not any cheaper at age 65, 66 or 67 than they are at age 76. One could even say that they are more expensive because it seems as though people generally eat less and less as they get older. I am being somewhat ironic here, and I hope that everyone takes it that way, but these are serious and important issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906194"> I am concerned. I am concerned about the new <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. I will not say “the new government”, because another sentence in the motion says that this so-called new government is following the same plan as the old one. I quite agree with that statement as well. The Liberal leader may have a new face, but putting a new label on a jar of peanut butter does not change the fact that it is still the same old peanut butter in the jar. That analogy has been used in the House before, and I really like it. I want to remind people that this is the same government that we have had since 2015. The Liberals will boast  about how interest rates have just gone down and about how wonderful they are, but when interest rates go down, it is because the economy is slowing down. When it comes right down to it, we have a government that is bragging about a downturn in economic activity and that seems to takes pride in the fact that the GDP per capita is falling. That is not supposed to happen in a well-run G7 country. Everything I said in that last sentence is true except for two words, “well” and “run”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906195">This country is badly run. That is why we are happy to vote in favour of the motion. I say this for the benefit of my Conservative colleagues who are listening. I am not joking. I am genuinely happy to be able to vote with them. Often, only half of what is in the motions they present to us is true. They choose extremely important topics, but then they throw in a bunch of populist rhetoric and facile statements that force the adults in the room, by which I always mean the Bloc Québécois, to vote against them, because we cannot vote in favour of things that are not true. Today, though, we are happy. I congratulate the Conservatives. I want to give them a pat on the back and encourage them to keep going like this. That is what we call positive reinforcement. Today is a good day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906196">Ordinary folks are stretched to the limit, even if inflation is under control. We are glad it is under control, but it was so out of control for so long that prices are still too high compared to wages. That is the problem, and for the members opposite who are making such bold claims today, I would like to remind them of a little concept relating to public administration. It is possible and normal for a government, whether it is the federal government or the government of Quebec or a province, to run the occasional deficit. A deficit is a buffer that is there to help the economy. However, it is not normal to have repeated deficits, especially when the economy was already doing well to begin with. That is the problem. A government should run a deficit to stimulate economic growth when the economy is not doing well.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8906197">However, deficits have now been run so regularly and for so long that the government is in the process of inventing new ways to do accounting. The Liberals are going to present them on November 4, and I am looking forward to seeing what they have come up with. I hope Canadians will be savvy enough to see through the scam. The Liberals are going to present a deficit that will probably exceed $100 billion, but it will not show up because they will have separated the good debt from the bad debt.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906198">When we pay a debt, we have to actually pay the debt. The money has to be there. Furthermore, every time a government goes into debt, it means less money for direct services to the public, for direct transfers to the public. This is appalling. I am using that word advisedly, and I do not think it is too strong. We are sick of seeing this, we are outraged, and we would like the truth to be told. We are here as elected representatives of the people. An election campaign is supposed to last a month and a half. Now it is over, so can we talk now and look at what we can do for the common good? I know I am very naive, but that is part of my charm.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906199">People are hurting, and if we want to help them cope, we need to address the root causes of this problem. One of the ways that the government can help low-income individuals in a time of crisis is to give them direct support. I spoke about old age security earlier, but I also want to talk about employment insurance. How many years has this government been promising to reform employment insurance? To answer my own question, it is now 2025 and they started talking about reform in 2015, or even before that. That is over 10 years ago. There has been no progress on that front, and yet people are required to contribute to the EI program even though nearly half of contributors are not even entitled to benefits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906200">Imagine people shopping around for home insurance and being told by one insurance company that it cannot reimburse them if their house burns down. Obviously, they will immediately move on to the next company. However, workers in this country are bound hand and foot. They are stuck with this lousy government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906201">If the government is incapable of managing money, it should transfer it to Quebec. Quebec will know how to manage it. In fact, the money ought to have been sent back to Quebec anyway because the federal government has a tendency to take advantage of crises and tough times to further centralize power. Do members know why the government centralizes power? It is because it has too much taxation power relative to its responsibilities. The government is not going to win many votes by making transfers to the provinces and Quebec based on the principle of sound administration. That just sounds like something that would be done by someone who is capable of managing their affairs properly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906202">The government members just want to make grand announcements from a balcony, outside on a sunny day, with the wind in their hair as they proclaim, “We're going to help Canadians, we're here for Canadians, we're going to help the middle class”. However, what we are seeing is that the middle class has been getting poorer the entire time. People are now turning to food banks. The list goes on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906203">Regarding grocery prices, as the Bloc Québécois agriculture and agri-food critic, I want to mention that the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food has taken a very smart, meticulous approach to studying this issue and that we have identified issues and put forward solutions. This may not be of interest to everybody, but we have found solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906204">For example, the code of conduct aimed at improving the bargaining power of small suppliers with respect to big grocery chains is still being implemented. It is a long and arduous process, but it is a measure that could change things. Let me give another example. If we want to tackle the cost of food, we need to stop increasing the cost of inputs. When we choose to tax fertilizers, we should not be surprised when food products become more expensive. There is a logic to all this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906205">I would also like to correct some misinformation that we are being given. The government is telling us that Canada's debt is acceptable because it represents about 45% of the GDP—it was 42% before, so it is still 3% higher—and it is comparing us to other G7 countries. In France, for example, there are no provinces that can incur debt. In other words, we are talking about total debt. In Canada, if you add the debt of Quebec and the provinces to that of the federal government, you reach about 100% to 110% of GDP. That is equivalent to France's and the United Kingdom's debt, and close to that of Italy, so things are not going so well after all. We need to start taking this seriously and helping people who need it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906206">I still have a lot more to say. Let us start by cutting the infamous $83 billion for oil companies.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906227"> Mr. Speaker, for centuries, alchemists promised to transform lead into gold, and they failed. What is surprising is that after each failure, they still managed to convince one group of people after another with their promise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906228">Today, the chief alchemist, the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, is promising to transform deficits into investments. He presents this as a new promise, but in reality, it is the same promise the Liberals have been making for 10 years, since October 2015. Given that we have been hearing the same promises for a decade, it is high time to consider whether or not all this is working.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906229">Let us take a look at the results. Among the G7 countries, Canada has seen the slowest growth in per-capita investment. Of the G7 countries, we have had the worst GDP per capita. Canada invests $15,000 for every worker here. That is about half of what is invested in the United States, where they invest $29,000. It a third less than the OECD average.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906230">Since coming to power, the Prime Minister has doubled the deficit. Has there been an increase in investment? No. We have lost $54 billion. He promised the American President that his government's policies would take an additional $1 trillion out of Canada over the next five years. More deficits mean less investment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906231">The Liberals did not manage to get the budget to balance itself nor did they manage to spend less to invest more. The alchemists failed to transform the lead of debt into the gold of investment.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906232">For centuries, alchemists promised and failed to transform lead into gold, but that is not the surprising part. What is surprising is that after each debunking, they would manage to repeat the same promise and convince even more people. It would always come with a new salesman and some flashy new jargon, always designed to dupe yet another group of people who had dreams of gold.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906233">Today's alchemist-in-chief, the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, promises to transform deficits into investments. This is not a new promise; it is exactly the same one that Justin Trudeau ran on in 2015. We remember that he said the budget would balance itself. To be fair to him, we all thought it was just a gaffe. What he actually meant was that deficit spending would spark investment which would grow the economy, generating enough money for the budget to balance itself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906234">The current <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has a slightly more sophisticated-sounding but similar idea, which is to spend less and invest more, but given that he has now taken office, accelerated the spending and doubled the deficit, it is now time for us to consider the actual results. What actually happened? Well, since the Liberal government took office, the debt has doubled, growth has stalled, investment has fallen, the budget did not balance itself and, of course, lead did not become gold.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906235">Let us look at the facts. The core facts are these: Under the government, Canada has had the single-worst growth in investment per capita of any country in the G7. I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="318132" Type="2">Newmarket—Aurora</Affiliation>, who will tell the House that in fact the reality is that if we take total investment divided by the number of workers in Canada, we get about $15,000 in investment per worker, which is barely half of the $29,000 in the United States and a third lower than the $24,000 across the OECD.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906236">The result has been that we have had the worst per capita GDP growth in the G7. Dressing up the deficits in a banker's suit has not made any difference, because since the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took office, doubling the deficit, which is the rate at which we add new debt, we have actually seen investment drop by $54 billion. Just the other day, he promised that his policies would drive another trillion dollars out of this country into the United States, proving once again, the result, that deficits do not equal investment. Why is this?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906237">There are a number of reasons. First, everything comes from something. There are only two ways for governments to run deficits: print money or borrow it. If it prints it, it causes inflation, which drives up interest rates, which drives down investment. If it borrows money, it has to borrow it from somebody. If the government borrows it out of the private economy to put it into the government economy, this means that the money that has been borrowed away from private investors is no longer available for productive investments in factories, mines, pipelines, new technology or other income-generating assets.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906238"> In other words, when government runs deficits, it does not create net economic activity; it simply shifts the activity away from productive private sector activity towards unproductive bureaucratic inactivity. It moves the money from where it is efficient to where is inefficient. By the way, that is called the crowding out effect. It is well known that this happens, and it is why deficits have coincided with drops in investment in most countries around the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906239">The second reason is that today's deficits are tomorrow's taxes, and everybody knows that. What businesses and individuals do when they see governments racking up massive deficits is hoard their cash, waiting for the eventual tax bill. We saw this during COVID, when small businesses would say that with all the debt, they were holding onto their wallet because they knew a big tax hike was coming. They would put their money under their bed, not investing or spending it. They waited for it to be taxed away later on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906240">This is what economists call the Ricardian equivalence, and it very much proves that there is no net economic activity that results from government deficits; in fact, it only subtracts from the productive investments that people might otherwise make, but they are suspended in terror that they will have a future tax liability, and they therefore do not make those investments at all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906241">What we have seen is that when deficits are cut, investment is actually increased. Governments across Canada slashed deficits in the 1990s, and we saw a resulting boom in investment. The greatest example of all is Israel. In the 1990s, Israel was running massive deficits that required the government of that country to pay out 6% yields on its bonds. Investors could, in a very lazy way, simply buy government bonds instead of taking risks on productive investments, and that led to poor economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906242"> When Israel started to cut the deficits and in fact balance its budget, the investors could no longer lend to the government, so they had to invest in productive assets. This caused a boom in start-ups, to the point where Israel now has the single-highest density of high-tech companies in the world. As a country of 10 million people, it has more companies listed on the NASDAQ than does all of Europe combined, a continent with 75 times more people. Cutting deficits forces investors to invest in productive assets like the technological booms in Israel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906243">The <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will say that he can get a better return on investment with his government-made investments in big economic projects, but there are questions. If the projects he wants to invest in are money-losers, why would the government want to invest in them? If they are money-makers, why would the government need to invest in them? If a project is going to lose money, then going forward with it makes us all poorer. If it is a megaproject, it makes us a lot poorer. The logic of going ahead with massive projects that lose money is like the businessman who says he loses money on every single sale but makes it up in volume.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906244">We do not need money-losing projects; we need money-making projects by having the fastest permits in the OECD, getting rid of the capital gains tax on reinvestments and having lower and marginal taxes on our highest achievers. In other words, the government only needs to get out of the way and stop telling us that it is going to turn deficits into investments or lead into gold. All it needs to do is get out of the way and allow Canadians to dig the beautiful gold mine that is right under our feet in Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906247">Mr. Speaker, first of all, the Liberals' argument that they are not as bankrupt as the other countries is not actually true, even if it were a good argument. To start with, Canada's debt is much higher than we see in most G7 countries when we include all debt levels, both public and private, because the Liberals have indebted our households with high taxes and high inflation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906248">I will give a lesson to the members across the way. We have one economy that has to pay the interest on all the debt in the country. The Government of Canada does not have a monopoly on the entire GDP. The GDP has to fund interest and debt servicing for households, businesses and governments. Because the Liberal government has indebted our businesses and households to the level that we are now one of the most indebted nations in the world on a per-GDP basis, we run very real risks that higher interest rates will absolutely cripple our economy. We need a paycheque economy, not a debt economy. </ParaText>

However, those are the defining characteristics of the government. This would never be acceptable in the private sector, and it should have no place in our government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906259">Year after year, the national debt keeps climbing. Interest payments now exceed what we transfer to provinces for health care. The deficit, once promised by the Liberal government to be modest and temporary, has now doubled. Instead of restoring discipline, the government is rewriting the rules and stretching the definition of capital investment so far that even subsidies, tax breaks and housing incentives are being rebranded as capital formation. What a joke. These are accounting tricks, a deliberate attempt to make the books look better than they are. More blatantly, the government knows it has lost control of Canada’s finances and is now redefining capital investment as a communications strategy to confuse Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906260"> The independent Parliamentary Budget Officer described this change as “overly expansive and exceeds international practice such as that adopted by the United Kingdom.” When a government starts changing definitions to hide the scale of its recklessness, it erodes the trust that underpins every dollar of public spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906261">Canadians deserve honesty and transparency. They deserve a government that manages the nation's finances, not manipulates them. While the Liberals manipulate the way they will present the budget, the deficit is set to balloon to $68.5 billion. This debt will be carried by my generation and by my children’s generation. It is generational debt. It is generational betrayal. A mortgage placed on the future of our children is a failure of duty.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906278">Mr. Speaker, there has been some verbal sparring between the various parties since the beginning of this debate. However, there is one thing that has not been mentioned, and that is the fact that this is a minority government. The government received a minority mandate from the people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906279">Normally, in that sort of context, the government must ask an opposition party for help in passing the budget. I have not heard any rumblings about the government deciding to consult with any given opposition party to determine whether they have demands and whether they could agree on the budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906280">My question is this: Is this government behaving like a majority or a minority government?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906282">We cannot spend our way to affordability. We cannot continue to spend and spend and pretend there are no consequences. There are consequences.

              <ParaText id="8906288">Mr. Speaker, I have been following this conversation with a lot of interest, and I am quite surprised by what we are hearing from members opposite. They claim to know the economy, fiscal prudence and what investment is about, but as we heard in question period yesterday, they do not seem to know what the private sector really is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906289">I suppose one thing I might share with my colleagues across the way is some fact. The fact is that Canada's economic position right now is the strongest relative to other G7 countries. It is in the strongest position in the G7 right now in terms of economic growth. We heard statistics that are inconvenient for the opposition, such as the fact that Canada is now among the top nations for foreign direct investment. Opposition members talk about investment leaving the country, but the reality is that more and more people want to invest in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906290">Why is this? People want to invest in this country because of clear facts. First, there is a stable government run by somebody who actually understands how the markets work. Second, people understand that Canadians are not just resilient but also understand innovation and what it takes to be able to deliver the goods. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906291">I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="318042" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation>, who will also, I am sure, have lots to add on this point.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906292">The reality we see right now, the facts on the ground, are that when we look at Canada's position globally, we are the strongest economy. We have the strongest potential economy in the G7 and are in the best economic position. Members heard the metrics already from my friend from <Affiliation DbId="317570" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> regarding the debt-to-GDP ratio.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906293">The reality the Conservatives refuse to accept is that Canada is actually well positioned to deal with global uncertainty. We can look at economic instability south of the border and the economic instability caused in Europe as a result of the Russian invasion in Ukraine; people are looking to Canada as an island of stability. They are looking to Canada as a place where workers are ready to roll up their sleeves and do great things, where innovators are building for the economy of the future. We are making transformational investments in digital and AI, which is where the world needs us to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906294">Why Canada? It is because Canada has proven itself to be a trusted partner, a reliable ally and a place where our word matters. That matters to the world. It matters in trade, in commerce and in business when someone's word is their bond. People are looking to this country and saying that they know they can place their investment dollars here. They know they can place their interests here because Canadians know how to value those investments and build with those investments, and they know they can trust their investments will be safe and secure, because the fiscal position of this country is in outstanding shape.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906295">Conservatives would like to be able to spin a narrative that Canada is broken. We all saw how that worked in the last election. Canadians believe in Canada. The government believes in Canada, and the Liberals believe in Canada; that is why Canadians returned us to lead this country. They did not buy the “Canada is broken” mandate, because they know Canada is not broken. They know Canada is the place that will lead when the world is in trouble.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906296">Canada is going to lead, and that is why Canadians put their confidence in us. Had they believed the Conservatives' narrative, the members opposite would have been sitting on this side. That is an unfortunate reality for them. It is a fortunate reality for Canadians, because Canadians see a government that is leading with optimism and pragmatism. They see a government leading with fact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906297">Let us talk about some of the facts. Conservatives talk about failed policies. They think providing dental care to five million Canadians is a failed policy. They are saying to more than 16,500 residents of my riding that it is a failed policy that they can now access dental care. They are talking to tens of thousands of parents who have benefited from $10-a-day child care and saying that it is a failed policy. I wonder how many of their voters are taking advantage of those very same $10-a-day day care spots.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906298">
                <B>An hon. member:</B> There are 3,000 on a wait-list, bud.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906299">
                <B>Taleeb Noormohamed:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member opposite is yelling that there are 3,000 people on a wait-list. This shows there is demand for a government program. That is clearly not a failed policy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906300">On top of that, Conservatives talk about caring about Canadians and young people in this country. They talk about their concern about the prices of food. They voted against a school food program. They voted against a program that gave parents the ability to ensure that their kids, where necessary, would have food in their bellies. That is who these Conservatives are. They are no longer the Progressive Conservatives of old, who understood that strong social policy and strong economic management can be matched.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8906301">The Conservatives have turned their back on economic management. We saw some of the largest deficits in Canadian history under the previous Conservative government. They have turned their back on caring for Canadians. That is what this new right-wing Conservative opposition has become, and that is why Canadians have turned their back on the Conservatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906302">Let us talk about the future. Let us talk about what Canadians are looking for. In a world where sovereignty matters, digital sovereignty is at the top of what we are investing in. Why are we investing in that sovereignty? We are investing in that sovereignty because Canadians' data, important information about Canadians; Canadian research; and Canadian innovation need to be protected from governments that may not act in the best interest of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906303"> When we were investing in the sovereign cloud, when we were investing in compute capacity in this country and when we were investing in quantum in this country, we were investing in data centres to make sure that Canadians know they can be protected in a world where technology and artificial intelligence are everywhere. What we are saying is that we are building for the future, not just for Canada but for the world. We are saying to European partners that they can trust Canada, they can trust our rules and they can trust our guidelines. We understand that innovation should not come at the cost of workers, and it should not come at the cost of values. One can innovate and still treat people with dignity and respect. That is the balance we are trying to set on this side of the House when it comes to investing in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906304"> Investments, as we all know, require all of us to think about the future for the long term. While members opposite may be thinking sound bite to sound bite, our government is thinking generationally for what matters to Canadians and for the future of this country. That is why the investments that we are making matter to Canadians. We are ensuring that we are able to maximize our natural resources while also protecting our environment. We are investing generationally in building homes for Canadians, something that the Conservatives would know nothing about. We are investing in the technologies of the future today. Those investments are creating the jobs of the future. We are setting up Canadians for the jobs of the future by ensuring that they have the money to train and retrain. Therefore, we are putting the money of the economy where our mouth is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906305">We are not just saying that tax cuts are going to solve everything, but we did that. We have put more money into the pockets of Canadians by cutting taxes while also investing. It proves that we can think about investing in the future while also making life more affordable today. That is what the premise of this government is. We are spending less and investing more. For people who do not understand the difference, it is very clear. Families may spend less at home on things like a Starbucks coffee so that they can invest in their RSPs. In our family when we are talking about prudence, that is how it works. People take money that they do not need to spend on the day-to-day so they can put it into things that are going to deliver a return for them in the future. That is how families plan. That is how governments plan. That is how we are planning for the future of this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906306">
                <B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906307">
                <B>Taleeb Noormohamed:</B> The Conservatives may laugh, Mr. Speaker. They may laugh because they think it is funny to think about the concept of managing our economy in a responsible way, making prudent investments that are going to be there for the future of Canadians. That is okay because they are not running this country; thankfully, we are. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906308">The reason that we are in this position is that Canadians trusted the vision of the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They understood that pragmatism and thoughtfulness can be paired with compassion and resilience. They understood that in the time we are in, when we are facing the significant challenges to our economy from the United States, strong stewardship, building a Canadian economy and working together across jurisdictions in a way that is unprecedented would be best handled by our government and best handled by our Prime Minister and by the members on this side of the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906309">I look forward to the opposition motion being defeated, as it should be, as the Conservatives were in the last election, so that we can continue the hard work and the important work of building Canada in a way that works for all Canadians.</ParaText>

It is a Canada that is prosperous and dynamic, that looks at differences as strength, that invests in the economy of the future, that takes the steps required to ensure that Canadians are trained for that and that does not turn its back on Canadians in their moment of need.

              <ParaText id="8906328">This debate is taking place at a time of unprecedented upheaval and readjustment in the global trading system, and it is irresponsible for an opposition political party to try to ignore this and bury its head in the sand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906329">We know that the world is changing. Accordingly, Canadians expect their government to react appropriately. The debate we are having today goes beyond the walls of this Parliament. It is happening all over Quebec and Canada, including in my riding, Trois-Rivières, in kitchens, living rooms, at Tim Hortons, in meeting rooms and at workplaces from coast to coast. Canadians and Quebeckers know exactly what is at stake here. Our government knows it too.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8906330">While the party opposite is focused on petty politics and simplistic slogans, our government is listening to Canadians. What is more, we are taking decisive action on what we have heard. In the face of this uncertainty, Canadians have called for serious plans to address this new economic landscape and its consequences, not a $106-billion budget. They have asked for change that puts more money in their pockets, change that builds the strongest economy in the G7 and change that builds one Canadian economy instead of 13. Our new government is responding to this call for change, and that is what Canadians are expecting of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906331">From a middle-class tax cut, which is saving money for 22 million Canadians, to the elimination of the GST for first-time homebuyers on new homes up to $1 million, our government is putting more money in the pockets of Canadians. We removed the consumer carbon price as of April 1, helping to reduce fuel costs, including lower prices at the pump. Our middle-class tax cut alone will save two-income families up to $840 in 2026, and going forward, it is expected to deliver over $27 billion in tax savings to Canadians over the next five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906332">What is more, the bulk of this tax relief will go to those who need it most, which is to say those with incomes in the two lowest tax brackets, with nearly half going to those in the lowest tax bracket, those earning $57,000 or less, the same Canadians who stand to benefit from all the programs the party opposite voted against over the years, whether it is the dental care plan or day care. By eliminating the GST for first-time homebuyers on new homes at or under $1 million, and reducing it for first-time homebuyers between $1 million and $1.5 million, we are saving first-time homebuyers up to $50,000. Altogether, this means $3.9 billion in tax savings for Canadians over five years, allowing more young Canadians to enter the housing market and spurring the construction of new homes across the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906333">At the same time, we are seizing a generational opportunity to transform the Canadian economy through ambitious investments and a rigorous spending review, so we can spend less and invest more. We know that the global economy has changed, and Canada must change with it. We need to strengthen our economic power to provide Canadians with greater certainty, security and prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906334">We need a new fiscal approach to get there. The cornerstone of our new approach is a capital formation budgeting framework that will make capital investment a national priority. This can be done by distinguishing between spending that stimulates capital investment in the public and private sectors and day-to-day spending, and by allowing the government to prioritize spending that stimulates capital investment in the public and private sectors. It is actually quite simple, but we are only deciding to do it now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906335">This will result in more transparent decision-making and more taxpayer dollars allocated to investments that will grow our economy's potential. This new approach will put Canada in a better position to build the homes, infrastructure and industries our economy needs.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8906336">Our work on this front is already well under way. We recently, for example, launched Build Canada Homes, a new federal entity that will transform public-private collaboration and leverage modern methods of construction to catalyze the creation of an entirely new industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906337">This represents a critical new tool to better harness the use of public land, while offering flexible financial incentives to attract private capital, facilitate the undertaking of large portfolio projects, and support modern innovative manufacturers as they build the homes Canadians need. However, it is not only the Canadian housing industry we are transforming. We are also streamlining the federal approval process to get major projects built faster. Working in close partnership with provinces, territories, indigenous peoples and private investors, we launched the Major Projects Office, which is going to work to fast-track nation-building projects by streamlining regulatory assessment and approval and to help structure financing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906338">Our government is moving with urgency and determination to advance this process, so Canada can build the infrastructure that will transform our economy to become the strongest in the G7. We are doing so because, for too long, the construction of major projects has been stalled by onerous and inefficient approval processes, which have stood in the way of investment. By removing these barriers and bringing new investments online, we will, in turn, create well-paying jobs for thousands of Canadians, supporting families and communities across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906339">What is more, we are undertaking these transformative changes to budgeting and investment on a solid fiscal footing, because the reality is Canada's deficit and net debt-to-GDP ratios are among the lowest among the advanced economies in the world. Let me just repeat that, because this is what I am talking about with facts versus slogans. Canada's deficit and net debt-to-GDP ratios are among the lowest among the advanced economies of the world. This is in sharp contrast with where we were in the nineties and the eighties. It is safe to say we all, maybe not all of us, but many of us, remember those dark days. We remember when stubborn deficits were leading to a rapid rise in Canada's net debt burden, eroding our fiscal advantage, increasing the cost of debt financing, and weighing in on our ability to invest in our people and our future. We can all take heart that those days are over.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906340">ln 2024, Canada's net debt-to-GDP ratio stood at just 11.9%, compared to the G7 average, excluding Canada, of 100.4%. ln fact, Canada's net debt burden remains lower today than that of any G7 country prior to the pandemic. Canada is also expected to have had the smallest deficit in the G7 as a share of the economy this year. Canada is also one of only two G7 economies, along with Germany, to have an AAA credit rating. At least two of the three major global credit rating agencies are rating us AAA, and it is one that investors are expecting us to maintain. The result of this is Canada's borrowing cost is as low as possible. Achieving these positive results was not easy, but we were able to do that because the world believes in Canada. I really hope the opposition party can start showing they also believe in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906341">Our actions as a government will be guided by a new fiscal discipline. We will spend less and invest more. We are initiating a comprehensive expenditure review to ensure our programs and activities are efficient and aligned with our core mandate. We are also introducing a new budget cycle to ensure we are more closely aligned with construction season, providing increased certainty and predictability for businesses and investors, supporting more effective financial planning for federal departments and agencies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906342">Within this new fiscal framework, budget 2025 will set out our ambitious plan to build Canada strong, with a new industrial strategy that will transform our economy from one of reliance on specific trade partners to one that is more resilient to global shocks, built on the solid foundation of strong Canadian industries and bolstered by diverse international trade partners. We hope the opposition will stand with us.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906368">I am pleased to rise today on our opposition day motion that “the House call on the Liberal government to stop plagiarizing...Trudeau's failed policies and recognize that deficits drive investment and jobs down and the cost of living up.” I will start with a quote from Mr. Milton Friedman, who said, “Keep your eye on one thing and one thing only: how much government is spending, because that’s the true tax…If you’re not paying for it in the form of explicit taxes, you’re paying for it indirectly in the form of inflation or in the form of borrowing.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906369">That is dead-on for what is happening right now, just as it was during the past 10 years with the same Liberal government. It is not a different Liberal government. It is not a new government; it is the same Liberal government, the same tax-and-spend Liberal government. In 2015, the former prime minister was well known for responding to a question about his cabinet make-up, saying it was “because it's 2015”. However, that is what the government seems to be saying right now about its continual spending and out-of-control deficits, that it is because it is 2025.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906370">I say that because it is the same term and the same Liberal government. There is no new plan. It is the same tired cabinet with the same old <Affiliation DbId="318631" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, who will not answer what the deficit will be. Although the minister was asked repeatedly at committee what the deficit would be, we did not get a response, which Canadians deserve to hear. Instead, he told Canadians they “should rejoice” at our fiscal situation, yes, rejoice at rising unemployment, rejoice at the highest youth unemployment in decades, rejoice at the doubling of the deficits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906371">The <Affiliation DbId="318631" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> is telling Canadians they should be happy with what is going on. They should rejoice at our fiscal situation, rejoice that the interest on the Liberal debt is going to be $82 billion a year by 2030. Put in perspective, that is about $3,000 out of their pockets for every taxpayer right off the bat, just for interest on the Liberal debt. They should rejoice at the fact that the last two years for GDP per capita, per person economic growth in Canada, shrunk by almost 3%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906372">“Canadians should rejoice” about being poorer, according to the <Affiliation DbId="318631" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, and they should rejoice over the fact that the last five years, which coincide with the five years that the current <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was advising the Liberal government on economic policy, has been the worst five-year per capita GDP growth since the Great Depression. Think about that. It was worse than the five years covering the 2008-09 economic crash. Yes, we should rejoice, the same as the old finance minister who got demoted and is now off being a special envoy somewhere.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906373">We should be happy. We have never had it so good. Every 30-year-old who is living in their mom's basement because they cannot afford to move out should make sure to rejoice and thank the Liberal government, as it says we should do. There are two million Canadians lining up every single month at food banks. One out of every 20 Canadians in the entire country is lining up at a food bank. They should take time, while they are lining, up to rejoice, as the <Affiliation DbId="318631" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906374">Mortgage delinquencies have almost tripled in parts of the country in the last two years.

              <ParaText id="8906375">There are a lot of things I can agree with the government on, and I know I have voted on some items, but there is a lot I disagree with. That is fine; we can disagree. I just want the government to be truthful to Canadians. Government members should not have sat here in the House for years, defending the carbon tax and telling Conservatives that we are climate deniers or that we only want to see the world burn if we want to take our kids on a summer vacation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906376">They should not not sit here and tell Canadians that their carbon tax is going to prevent forest fires or flooding. They should be honest with Canadians. We saw what the government did for years: It went after everyone who dared go after its dogma of the carbon tax. What happened the second it became unpopular? Liberals patted themselves on the back for cancelling the carbon tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906377">A year ago, if someone was against the carbon tax, the old health minister, Mark Holland, would say that Canadians were going to burn the world down if they took their kids on a summer drive. The Liberals now say to thank them for getting rid of the carbon tax. The Liberals are now pretending they are pro-oil, pro-Alberta or pro-energy. They sit here and say that there are no proponents for new pipelines, but at the same time, they refuse to repeal Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, the “no new pipelines” bill. They refuse to repeal Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document>, which bans tankers from taking Alberta oil up the B.C. coast but of course still allows U.S. tankers there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906378">They refuse to repeal the emissions and production cap that the Conference Board of Canada says will cost over 100,000 jobs in Canada. The Liberals should be honest; they should not sit here and say, “We love oil and gas. If only we had a proponent to build a pipeline.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906379">Liberals are all for oil as long as it stays politely in the ground, it seems. Their position regarding oil and gas is very much like saying that I will push a person down the stairs but also make sure someone pats me on the back for calling 911 to help that person afterward. That is what they seem to be doing with oil and gas: saying that we will be an energy superpower and that we will develop oil and gas but keep Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document> and the production cap, and that it will not be the Liberals' fault that no one steps up from the private sector.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906380">The capital gains tax is another example. I just want the government to be honest. We heard the old finance minister say, basically, that Canadians are going to be living behind gated communities to keep out lower-income people who want to burn down their homes unless we have the capital gains tax. She stated, “[We] could finance [it] by taking on more debt. But that would place an unfair burden on our younger generations”, yet the Liberals are going to add $60 billion of debt this year alone. She then urged Canadians to mark politicians who voted against the capital gains tax increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906381">The current <Affiliation DbId="318631" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> said that the “capital gains tax change [will] help Canadians” and that the Liberals “will fight for Canadians...will fight for the middle class.” He went on to ask whether members could believe that the Conservatives voted against the capital gains tax and tax fairness. The Liberals were going to increase investment in Canada, because their new capital gains tax would ask the wealthiest to pay a bit more to fund investments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906382">Move ahead a couple of months, and the <Affiliation DbId="318631" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, the same one who says we should rejoice at rising unemployment, that auto workers, I guess, should rejoice that we are going to have a permanent export tax on cars, permanent tariffs that are going to cause the industry to collapse, says that by tackling the capital gains tax, we are supporting builders, investment and entrepreneurs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906383">Is there any reason we doubt the Liberals when they say they are going to build the fastest-growing economy in the G7, while at the same time they bring in massive deficits that are going to drive out private sector investments? Their policies are causing massive, record increases to the use of food banks. Is there any reason no one trusts the Liberals? Everything was all-in on the carbon tax and the capital gains tax. All the borrowing they were going to do was going to drive investment into Canada, yet under the Liberals, half a trillion dollars in net investment has fled the country, with the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s promising that another trillion dollars will flee Canada into the U.S. under their watch.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906384">It is clear that we need a change. It is clear that the government has to end its Trudeau-era policies and get real with Canadians. It has to be honest with Canadians, be upfront and change its ways before it is too late.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906399">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise here today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906400">What we are talking about today with this motion is ending the Justin Trudeau-style economic philosophy and the Justin Trudeau-style budgeting and getting back to the basics here. We are talking about investments today and different things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906401">Before I get started, I should congratulate the Toronto Blue Jays on a great victory and a great series. It was excellent. We can all agree on that in the House. It is a bit of unity before we get the punching in. What did the Blue Jays do? We can give them credit for private investment. They spent $750 million over the past few years updating the Rogers Centre, and they did not ask for any government money that I know of. They had a business case, they went about it and they did it. I think they did it on time and on budget. Now, they are into the next round of playoffs, and they are getting their return on investment. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906402">That is really what we are talking about here today. We have to unleash the private business investment in this country. We have to become more attractive to foreign companies and our own domestic companies so they make a decision to invest in Canada. There is far too much red tape and obstruction to do that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906403">There was a Liberal MP who spoke about 20 minutes ago, and what she said was interesting. She said that the Liberals created a new program to deal with all the red tape and delay in the programs. Well, guess who created all that red tape and delay in the programs? The Liberal government has been around so long that it is trying to fix the devastation it created, but that is never going to happen, because the Liberals do not know how to fix it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906404">If we go back 10 years, Stephen Harper and Joe Oliver delivered a budget in the legacy of Jim Flaherty. It was a balanced budget. The government expenditures that year were $289 billion for a balanced budget. The entire net debt for the country was $610 billion, which is a lot. The debt-to-GDP ratio at that time was just over 31% and declining. We really were, after a number of years, becoming a destination for the world to do business. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906405">Justin Trudeau came along and said, “Look, I'm just going to spend a bit more over the next three years. I'm going to have a balanced budget in 2020 and a little deficit in the medium term, or $10 billion a year, so some investment can kick-start the economy.” Now, that should have been deadpanned right from the beginning because, with a $2-trillion economy, $10 billion is really not going to get the job done. Right from the beginning, we knew it. Canadians should have known that, when a person comes in with that kind of philosophy, it is going to fail. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906406">Fast-forward to today and the net debt is $1.2 trillion to $1.3 trillion, and the gross debt is way more. The debt-to-GDP ratio for just Canada, not for all the provinces combined, is 45%, I believe. The deficit this year, incredibly, will be higher than a Justin Trudeau deficit at approximately $62.5 billion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906407">All the while, the Liberals have been telling Canadians that we just need to invest a little more to the point where, now, in 2024-25, I believe total government expenditure is at $450 billion. In 10 years, we have increased the size of government by well over 50%, we have more than doubled Canada's debt permanently and we have added burden onto young Canadians that will last their lifetime and generations down the line, all because Justin Trudeau said 10 years ago that we were going to make a wee investment. He used the phrase “modest short-term deficit”. He also used a phrase that came back to bite him pretty hard: “the budget will balance itself”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906408">The other chief architect of this commentary is now the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He was Trudeau's adviser all the way along. When Canadians were looking at him in the winter and through the spring, they thought, “Boy, we've really broken away from this Trudeau guy.” However, what they really did was elect Trudeau on steroids. Now, months later, people cannot believe what they got, and I know because I am out in my community all the time. It is not just in finance and business. It is in everything. It is universal disappointment.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906409">We need to get back to the basics. We need to create an economic climate where we can invite people to do business in our country. We need transparency. We need to know exactly what the rules are. Think about how many times the rules have changed since the Liberals have been in government over the past 10 years. For big projects and little projects, everything is changing all the time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906410"> He said one thing that might be the worst lie he could have told a Canadian, which was that the Liberals took on debt so Canadians would not have to. A lot of Canadians took that literally, five years ago. They are really being hit now, to the point where they are giving keys back to the bank and there are record lineups at food banks. It goes on and on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906411">Ten years ago, when Stephen Harper, Jim Flaherty and Joe Oliver were putting together budgets, a young family had a future. They could afford to buy a home. They could afford to save for their kids' education. They could put food on the table and not have to rely on government food programs to feed their children at lunchtime. People could afford to buy groceries and put it in their kids' lunch boxes. Canadians could afford to raise their kids, play sports and go on a vacation. They could do all these things. They may have had to work a bit of overtime and save from time to time, but it could be done. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906647">Mr. Speaker, it being Thursday, it is time for the Thursday question. I would like to use this opportunity to ask a few very specific questions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906648">First and foremost, we see that the embattled <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> has had to come, cap in hand, back to the House of Commons and restart his efforts with Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>. It was literally the first piece of legislation the government introduced, and the government has had to do a complete do-over because it got it so wrong, infringing on Canadians' individual rights and liberties, completely violating charter principles of the right to privacy and due process. Now that the Liberals have tabled the do-over, mulligan piece of legislation, I would like to ask them when they might be calling that piece of legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906649">Second, I would like to ask the Liberals something very specific. The member for <Affiliation DbId="318147" Type="2">Similkameen—South Okanagan—West Kootenay</Affiliation> has asked for an emergency take-note debate on softwood lumber. We note that yesterday the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> came home empty-handed; he did not get a deal on softwood lumber tariffs. Many mills have been closing across the country, and my colleague, who represents a lot of the forestry workers in British Columbia, has asked for an emergency take-note debate. I am wondering if the government will agree to that and schedule such a debate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906650">I would also like to seek the opportunity to help inform the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He said during question period that the Liberals voted against something that does not exist when it comes to the oil and gas production cap. I have here the actual regulations for the oil and gas production cap. Perhaps the Prime Minister has not had a chance to read that, but, if the House gives its consent, I will table that right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906651">Maybe the government could also tell us what the business will be for the rest of this week and all of next week.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906668">Mr. Speaker, I really think question period today highlighted the fracture in philosophies on the best way forward for the Canadian economy. What we heard in question period today from the Liberals, time and again, was that if we keep spoon-feeding and force-feeding the failed policies of the last 10 years, it might work, instead of letting free enterprise and the capital market move forward with the ability to invest on its own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906669">In question period today, the Liberals were talking about direct foreign investment into Canada. The reality is that it is almost zero when there are no government dollars attached to that investment. We have seen those investments in Ontario and in different places. However, they would have never happened under the current economic climate unless there were taxpayer dollars involved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906670">If we go back in time, that was not the case. Large corporations could examine the Canadian market, take a look at the investment climate, the labour pools and all the different services that went into it. I am talking about before 2015. They could make their own decisions, and they did not need Canadian taxpayer dollars to make the investments; they would just come here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906671"> It has not been great in the last 10 years. In fact for Canadian companies, unfortunately, the majority of the time when they have a chance to make an investment in Canada, they definitely are not doing so. They are choosing somewhere else. Unfortunately we see that in the news every day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906672">Another one is AI. It is a buzz word on the news, in business and everywhere else. At the beginning of the year, the United States announced there would be a $500-million investment into the broader AI sector. None of that was government dollars; it was all private dollars. There has actually been a lot more since that, NVIDIA being the greatest example. It is allocating $100 million out of its own free cash into AI, ChatGPT, in the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906673">It is pretty quiet up here in Canada. The only investment we really see is from the Government of Canada. Why is that? It is because the climate, not the weather climate but the investment climate, is not great. The other thing is that there is no extra electrical capacity in this country, partially because of all the red tape in seeking approval to start projects.</ParaText>

Over 20 years ago in my riding, where I used to work, the owner of Wescast Industries at the time made a decision to make a huge investment in Wingham, Ontario to build a new foundry where exhaust manifolds would be built and sold around the world. It was the largest manufacturer of them in the world. There were 2,000 employees in Ontario at Wescast Industries during the period of 2003 to 2004. Do members know how many there are today?

              <ParaText id="8906694">Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="317586" Type="2">Madawaska—Restigouche</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906695">Before I begin my speech, I would like to wish all my colleagues here in the House a happy Thanksgiving. I hope they have a good time with their families and enjoy this time in their ridings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906696">Once again, we find ourselves debating a Conservative Party motion that is long on slogans but short on substance. Canadians deserve a serious government that is capable of having serious conversations about how to grow our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906697">While the Conservatives continue to trash-talk Canada, our government is working to build a stronger, more resilient Canadian economy, the strongest in the G7. To achieve that, we are investing in Canadians, in Canadian innovation and in the industries that will define the next generation of growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906698">Our government is well aware that many Canadians are struggling to make ends meet. They have a lot of bills to pay, housing is expensive and buying food to feed a family costs a lot. We understand this reality, and that is why Canadians gave this government a mandate to take concrete action that would make life more affordable. Canadians did not put their trust in the Conservatives for one very simple reason: They did not offer Canadians a plan for the economy, they offered them tired slogans and hollow rhetoric.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906699">Let us recall the facts: Canada has the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio and the lowest deficit in the G7. We have a AAA credit rating from all the major agencies, making us one of only two G7 countries that can claim that distinction. Our inflation rate has remained within the Bank of Canada's target range for over a year and a half, and our policy interest rates are lower than policy interest rates in the United States or the United Kingdom. These are not slogans; these are facts. These are results that people can count on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906700">Canada's new government is focused on implementing a plan to overcome the cost of living challenges affecting Canadians across the country. On November 4, the <Affiliation DbId="318631" Type="4">Minister of Finance and National Revenue</Affiliation> will table our government's first budget, which will lay out our plan to build a stronger and more resilient economy. It will include investments in housing and infrastructure that will encourage significant private sector investment and help build new reliable partnerships.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906701">Since forming government, we have taken several steps to help Canadians and to put more money in their pockets. I will provide some examples. One of the very first measures we took as the new government was to give a tax break to the middle class to help hard-working Canadians keep more money in their pockets. Nearly 22 million Canadians are already benefiting from our middle-class tax cut.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906702">This tax cut will help double income families save up to $840 in 2026. In the future, it should help Canadians save more than $27 billion in taxes over the next five years. This reduction in the income tax threshold will benefit Canadians across the country, and most of the tax cut for the middle class will go to people in the two lowest tax brackets, with nearly half going to those in the first bracket, which is $57,375 and below in 2025.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906703">Thanks to this tax cut for the middle class, the lowest marginal tax rate has been reduced from 15% to 14% effective July 1, 2025. This tax cut is helping hard-working Canadians to keep more of their paycheque to spend where it matters most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906704">Our government is also fully aware that Canada is in the midst of a housing crisis. Although improvements have been noted recently in many cities, too many Canadians, particularly young people, are having a hard time finding affordable housing. That is why our government is implementing a new and ambitious approach to increase the housing supply in Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8906705">For example, our government will remove the GST for first-time buyers of new homes priced at $1 million or less and reduce the GST for first-time buyers of new homes priced between $1 million and $1.5 million. This is significant relief, as first-time homebuyers can save up to $50,000 in total. This tax cut is expected to save Canadians $3.9 million over five years. With this GST relief, we are ensuring that first-time homebuyers, especially young people, have lower upfront costs and more money in their pockets for related expenses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906706">I am pleased to see that this tax cut will also have a dynamic effect on increasing supply by stimulating the construction of new homes across the country. Our commitment to help build more homes from coast to coast to coast does not stop there. We also recently launched Build Canada Homes, a brand new federal agency tasked with building affordable housing on a large scale. Build Canada Homes will rapidly build affordable prefabricated housing on federal lands.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906707">The agency will also help tackle homelessness by building transitional and supportive housing in collaboration with provinces, territories, municipalities and indigenous communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906708">It will help keep community housing very affordable for low-income households. It will speed up housing construction, create jobs and give private builders the certainty they need — and I do mean certainty — to build even more. Build Canada Homes aims to transform private-public sector collaboration by using modern construction methods and by fostering an all new Canadian housing industry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906709">Through all of these measures, our government is reducing taxes, lowering costs and giving money back to Canadians. However, while ongoing support for Canadians is important, we also understand the vital need for continued prudent management of Canada's finances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906710">We are guided by a new fiscal discipline. We will spend less and invest more. We will balance government operating expenses and revenues over the next three years by cutting waste, capping the public service, ending duplication and deploying technology to improve public sector productivity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906711">The <Affiliation DbId="318631" Type="4">Minister of Finance and National Revenue</Affiliation> will present the details of the new budget plan to the House on November 4.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906712">Our government has also eliminated the consumer carbon tax to refocus carbon pricing on large emitters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906713"> With all these measures, our government is lowering taxes, bringing down costs and putting money back in the pockets of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906714">The federal budget will be comprehensive, effective, ambitious and prudent. It will focus on growth, productivity and long-term prosperity. It will meet this moment, build the strongest economy in the G7 and build a strong and free Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906715">Meanwhile, the Conservative Party's plan, if one can call it that, changes from week to week. One day, they promise all kinds of cuts; the next, they pretend to support investment. They talk about helping Canadians, but they vote against measures that make life more affordable. They voted against dental care, pharmacare, the national school food program, affordable housing and clean energy projects in their own ridings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906716">They claim to stand up for workers, but they oppose investment liberalization in pensions to boost productivity and support good jobs here at home. They say they care about competitiveness, but they oppose investment tax credits that attract new industries to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906717">Canadians are not falling for it. When it is time to act, the Conservatives have no plan, only political stunts. They say that they balanced the budget, but it was a sleight of hand. They just fudged the numbers. They were able to balance the budget not by strengthening the Canadian economy, but by cutting frontline services, selling off assets and cutting corners on the backs of Canadians.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8906745"> Mr. Speaker, the motion before us today talks about the importance of investments, the cost of living and the economy. This is timely because Canadians gave our new government a strong mandate in the spring. They trusted us to build a strong economy that works for everyone. When we talk about an economy that works for everyone, we are talking about having measures in place to help Canadians deal with the cost of living.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906746">On this side of the House, when we say that affordability is an important issue, we follow up with concrete action. One of the first things we did when we came back to Parliament in the spring was pass a tax cut for over 22 million Canadians that will give them more purchasing power. It is a concrete measure that shows we are serious. When we say we are going to help people, we take action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906747">If we look at the Liberal record over the past few years, we see several examples of measures that were introduced to help the public, but which our Conservative colleagues opposed. I am thinking in particular of the Canadian dental care plan. During the election campaign, people told me that they needed dental care but could not afford it. The expansion announced last spring allows people who did not have access to these basic services to access them at an affordable cost. This is a real change for the public. Last week, the <Affiliation DbId="318692" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> announced that more than five million people are now enrolled in this program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906748">The Canada child benefit is a flagship measure that transfers money directly into parents' pockets to help them provide for their children. Since 2016, this measure has lifted more than 600,000 children out of poverty. In my region alone, more than $40 million a year is transferred to parents in my riding of Madawaska—Restigouche to help them provide for their children. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906749">Since 2021, more than 900,000 children have secured affordable child care spaces through our program. We understand that if we want to build a strong economy and a strong Canada, we need strong families. We need to enable parents, especially women, to be fully active in the workforce, and that means providing access to child care spaces. The opposition voted against this program, which is not surprising. When we look at the record of the leader of the official opposition, he has been against funding child care spaces for 20 years. If we delve into the House of Commons archives, we will see that one of his first speeches in 2005 was to oppose federal funding for a national child care program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906750">I am also thinking of the national school food program, which my official opposition colleagues also opposed. This program ensures that children go to school with full bellies. Some 400,000 children across the country are better off because of this program. We will be investing $11 million over the next three years to make this program available to more than 57,000 children in my province, New Brunswick. That is a big deal. We know the cost of living can be high sometimes, but children should never have to go to school on an empty stomach. That is why we are there for Canadians, there for children and there to provide them with healthy meals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906751">If we want to hang onto measures like these that make a big difference in people's lives, we need a strong economy. Our position is already strong according to economic statistics. Canada is the only G7 country other than Germany with a AAA credit rating. We have the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio of any G7 country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906752">In addition, the government is working to further strengthen the Canadian economy. I am thinking in particular of last June, when we passed the One Canadian Economy Act. This act removes federal barriers to interprovincial trade. We really want to unleash the potential of our domestic market and work to build one Canadian economy out of 13. This act also established the Major Projects Office. In fact, a whole list of projects was announced recently, and more are on the way. When these projects meet our stringent criteria, the question is not whether we will build, but how. We want to stimulate investment in the country because we know that when we stimulate investment, we create jobs and help Canadian businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906753">Then there is the important work being done by the Treasury Board. It is conducting a red tape review that has identified more than 500 superfluous regulations that are no longer needed and that actually hinder productivity and limit economic growth. We are going to get rid of those regulations. The review will continue because we want to demonstrate that Canada is a place where people can invest. That is another way we are stimulating the economy.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8906754">Our new buy Canadian policy also comes to mind. The Government of Canada is the largest purchaser of goods and services in the country. We have immense purchasing power, and we want to use it to support Canadian businesses. We will be providing the details of this policy in the coming months, but the idea is to prioritize Canadian goods and services wherever possible. It is about spending money here in Canada to stimulate our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906755">We are also here for workers across Canada. We recognize that the economic situation may be difficult for some people right now. That is why we have announced various measures related to the employment insurance program. For example, we waived the one-week waiting period for claiming EI benefits. People who need benefits will no longer have to wait a week before they can receive them. We also announced that we will allow people to keep their severance pay without affecting the amount of their benefits. For people who want to retrain, we have also announced various measures to support retraining for people who unfortunately lose their jobs and want to change sectors. Once again, these are concrete measures to help Canadian workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906756"> I would say that the motion before us today lacks substance. It seems less like the product of rigorous work and more like something designed to get clicks on social media. While the official opposition wastes time on an unserious motion, we are over here working away.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906757">The <Affiliation DbId="318631" Type="4">Minister of Finance and National Revenue</Affiliation> is working on an ambitious budget that will be tabled in the House on November 4. With this budget, we will seize a generational opportunity to transform the Canadian economy through ambitious investments and careful management of our public finances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906758">When I say ambitious investments, I am thinking of housing in particular. We announced the new Build Canada Homes agency, and we plan to invest in housing at a rate never before seen in Canada. We understand that people really need this. During the last election campaign, when I talked to people in my riding, they often told me that housing construction was a priority. When I sit down with the mayors in my riding of Madawaska—Restigouche, they tell me that we need to build housing more quickly in the communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906759">Millions of dollars in federal funding has already been invested back home in places like Edmundston, Campbellton, Saint-Quentin, the Madawaska Maliseet First Nation and the Eel River Bar First Nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906760">The federal government has invested millions of dollars in building housing. Some housing has already been built, and there are people in my riding living in housing that was funded with federal money. More sites are under construction. I will be visiting some of them next week. This is just the beginning. With the investments in the budget, we are going to increase the pace of residential construction. We are going to incentivize public-private partnerships in the housing sector. We are going to support the construction of affordable housing across the country because we know that it is a priority for Canadians, and they expect us to deliver.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906761">At the same time, these investments will allow us to stimulate the economy by prioritizing the use of Canadian products, like softwood lumber and steel.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906762">We have also announced historic investments in defence. Starting this year, will meet our 2% of GDP target to honour our commitments to NATO. With these historic investments in defence, we are also going to stimulate our economy. We are going to identify Canadian companies that can help us procure defence-related goods and services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906763">In conclusion, if my official opposition colleagues truly care about affordability and building a strong economy that benefits everyone, I hope they will support our efforts to pass the budget that will be tabled on November 4. As I said, this will be a generational opportunity to transform our Canadian economy. I sincerely hope that our opposition colleagues will work with us to achieve that.</ParaText>

After nearly a decade of the record showing the opposite, we have to wonder if we should still keep going in this direction. We have had record borrowing and record spending, with record debt and hardship among Canadians. Investment per worker has fallen by more than 10%; economic growth per capita is the worst in the G7, and the current <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has caused 86,000 jobs to be lost, resulting in the second-highest unemployment rate in the G7.

              <ParaText id="8906790">Behind every number is a person, a story deserving to be known. A few weeks ago, I spoke with Joy, a woman from my community who uses a wheelchair and lives on a fixed income. She called to tell me how desperate she has been in trying to find accessible housing. She has done everything she can. She is responsible, organized, determined and working hard, but as rents climb and the cost of living rises, every apartment she looks at is out of her reach. She told me she just wants a place where she can live with dignity. Is this not what most people want? These are the very basic necessities of life, and she just wants a place where she can live with dignity. My question for the government is what it would like me to tell her. What do I tell someone like Joy, who is doing all she possibly can but is not able to afford a basic roof over her head?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906791">Then there is Susie. Susie is a senior in my riding who reached out to me. She has worked hard her entire life, raised her family and contributed to the community. She pays her taxes faithfully. Now, in retirement, she finds herself unable to afford groceries and rent. She has to choose between the basic necessities of affording her rent or putting proper groceries in her fridge. Of course, the roof over her head is most important in her view, so she pays the rent, but she has turned to skipping meals in order to make it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906792">This is Canada, one of the richest nations in the world, yet our seniors are being forced to choose between food and rent.

It is the consequence of years of reckless fiscal policy that has driven up inflation, raised interest rates and punished those who have worked hard their whole lives. This is happening not just to seniors or those with a disability but to working families too.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906793">A couple who would prefer not to be named sat down with me and shared that both of them are working full time. They have three kids and are doing their best, but, at the end of the day, they are not able to afford the things they require as a family. These people have chosen to start skipping meals in order to make sure that their kids have enough to eat and that they can continue to put a roof over their head and function as a family unit. I could go on and on. There are dozens of these stories that come into my office almost monthly, and it keeps getting worse as time goes on. Folks have done everything right, but, for some reason, cannot get ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906794">This is what happens when a government spends beyond its means. Inflation is not an abstract concept; it is a thief, and it is the result of the government. It erodes purchasing power, punishes responsibility, makes the poor poorer and shrinks the middle class, yet the Liberal government continues to insist that deficits somehow make life more affordable and somehow Canadians are going to get ahead. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906795">They are not. The truth is the opposite. Every dollar the government borrows today is a dollar that people like Joy, Susie or the hard-working couple have to pay back. It is on their backs. It becomes their responsibility because of the government's irresponsibility.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906796">Just the other day, I overheard my office manager in the constituency talking to my intern. She was explaining to my intern that when people call or come into the office, sometimes they sound upset or maybe even a bit angry; sometimes, that can be a bit uncomfortable. However, my office manager put it into perspective. She offered an explanation and said that when they come in, they are not trying to be mean and they are not trying to be rude; they are desperate because of fear. They are afraid because they cannot afford rent. They are afraid because they cannot afford food. They are afraid because they cannot pay their bills, and they are desperate for help. They are afraid of what the future holds, because they do not see hope in it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906797">This insight reminded me of what is really at stake here. Behind policy debates and behind the economic charts and forecasts are millions of Canadians who are afraid. They are afraid they will lose their jobs, afraid they will be without a home and afraid they will never get ahead or be able to step into that opportunity that they so long for. These are the people I visit with each and every day when I am in my constituency. These are the people who share their stories with me, and they just want a fair shot at life. They need Canada to be as it once was, a place where opportunity is great and where the chance to get ahead is normal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906798">The Liberals told Canadians that their deficits would grow the economy from the heart out. How is that working? It is not. Instead, they have grown debt; they have grown dependence, and they have grown despair. That is what is on the current government's record. Since 2015, business investment in Canada has fallen off a cliff by about half a trillion dollars. It has gone south of the border. Companies do not want to invest here because they see a government that is hostile to them, a government that actually wants those jobs to go south, as the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has promised. He wants to send not just half a trillion dollars but a trillion dollars; that is his latest promise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906799"> The Liberals have been trying to convince Canadians that more spending is the solution to every problem that their spending has already created. If we would just take a second to consider that, it is like pouring gasoline on a fire to put it out. That is what the government is offering. That is what we can expect in the November 4 budget from the government: more spending to put out the fire that its inflationary spending has already caused. It is ludicrous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906800">The truth is simple. Government does not create wealth; it takes it from those who do, which means it is incumbent upon governments to be wise stewards. Every dollar government spends is taken from a taxpayer. It is taken from Joy, Susie and the hard-working couple I referenced earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906801">I want to be clear: The motion we are discussing today is not just about numbers; it is about people. It is about Joy, it is about Susie, and it is about that couple in my riding. Canadians are strong. They are resilient and hopeful, but they are losing faith in the current government, in the leaders of the day. Who can blame them? After nearly a decade of Liberal promises, Canadians are worse off than ever before. They need a government that respects their money, that lives within its means and that restores common sense to our economic decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906802">Conservatives are calling on the current Liberal government to stop its wasteful spending, which fuels inflation; to bring investment back to our country rather than sending it south of the border; and to make life affordable for hard-working Canadians again. I urge every member in the House to listen to the stories in their communities, to hear the pain and the anxiety behind the statistics and to recognize that the Liberal government's decisions are failing Canadians. Let us stop repeating Justin Trudeau's and the current <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s policies, and let us stop mortgaging our children's future. Instead, let us start building a Canada where every person, regardless of income or circumstance, has the opportunity to thrive. It is time to put those people, Canadians, first. It is time to rein in spending and be responsible.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906828">Mr. Speaker, we are here debating a motion at a point in this nation's history when Liberal delusion is meeting the fiscal reality of Canadians and Canadian businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906829">The delusion is that Canadians have never had it as good as they have it today. The reality is that Canadian families and single moms are worried about putting food on the table and keeping a roof over their heads. Canadian businesses are not investing. In fact, we are seeing a lot of investment leaving this country because of doubt and uncertainty and because of the tax regime of this country. Yesterday, I met with the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, and it is quite concerned about the tax regime in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906830">Delusion is actually meeting reality, and just this week, we learned of what that reality may look like. MNP financial issued a note on a survey it did. The reality of the headline, I think, speaks volumes as to where we are at today as a nation: “Canadians face ‘heat or eat’ decisions as financial strain deepens”. That is the headline this week. MNP financial did a survey of Canadians. Would members like to know what it found? Again, Liberal delusion is meeting the reality of Canadians: </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906831">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Canadians’ financial vulnerability is worsening, with the MNP Consumer Debt Index sliding two points to 86—its lowest September reading since 2023. Growing numbers report making painful trade-offs: 29% [of Canadians] have reduced utility consumption [which is up five points, year over year] and 24% say they are eating less to save money [which is down four points, year over year]. Nearly half [of Canadians] (48%) are within $200 of insolvency each month [which is up six points, quarter over quarter], and the average cushion after bills has fallen to $744 (from $916). Fewer than half (46%) have six months of emergency savings, leaving many households exposed as winter heating costs approach.</QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906832">Where are they cutting back? Again, it is Liberal delusion meeting with Canadian reality: “Beyond heat and food, Canadians are changing daily habits to cope. 51% are grocery shopping more strategically (meal plans, bulk buying, coupons, price matching). 45% are avoiding impulse purchases and 41% have stopped dining out or ordering takeout.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906833">When we listen to the Liberals, and we have heard them today, Canadians do not care about debt-to-GDP ratios, despite the fact that the Liberals are wrong. We have the second-highest unemployment rate in the G7. These are all the realities that Canadians are facing right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906834">Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. What today's motion says is that enough is enough. What the Liberals are doing is not working. The reality of Canadians is that they are suffering.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906835">Four million Canadians are using food banks. We have seen it increase in Barrie sixfold since 2020. Just a couple weeks ago, I was at the Barrie Food Bank. It is serving 7,600 families a month right now, and 44% of the people it is serving are children and seniors. Those who used to donate to the food banks are now users of food banks in Barrie. This is cascading across the country. Four million people are using food banks every month in this country. It should not be that way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906836">In the last government, we saw increased debt and deficit, which caused inflationary pressures that have caused many Canadians to feel the price increases at the stores for groceries, and for other items, including heat and hydro. They cannot afford to live anymore, based on the fiscal policies of the last 10 years.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8906837">The government has trumpeted the fact that it is a new government since the April election. The reality is that it is the same government since 70% of the people who are in that cabinet today were in cabinet in the Justin Trudeau government, and they are responsible for 80% of the spending occurring in the government today. It is not a new government. It is the same government employing and deploying the same tactics and the same strategy of debt and deficit that is causing so much hardship to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906838">After the last election, we have a <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> right now, who is not so much a PM, but more a portfolio manager, who promised the world to Canadians and that he was going to be different. He is anything but, because we are now seeing that the deficit is projected to be $60 billion. I suggest it is going to be a lot more than that. There are a lot of people who are much smarter than me who are suggesting it is going to be a lot more than that. We are also seeing debt increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906839">There is a budget coming November 4, which is basically a bait and switch. We know the Liberals are going to try to cover up as much as they can in terms of the actual amount of the debt and deficit through this new budget regime. They are not going to be fooling anybody. All eyes will be on the government to see just how much of a bait and switch this new budgetary regime it is announcing is going to cause.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906840">I say to people all the time that it is naive to think that the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> left a multi-billion dollar company making multiple millions of dollars for some virtuous reason to make $400,000 as the Prime Minister because he wanted to come back to save the nation. I have said this before in the House, but he came back to keep the kleptocracy alive, to allow those in the inside circle of the Liberal elite party, and all of those who are well-connected insiders and lobbyists, at the trough to maintain access to the Treasury.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906841">Every single problem we have in this country, such as the inflation, the debt, the deficits, the housing crisis, the health care crisis and the immigration crisis, everything, all started before Donald Trump became the President of the United States. Everything did, yet the Liberals continue to use Trump as an excuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906842">What we are saying with this motion today is that enough is enough. The Liberals cannot keep doing the things they are doing and expect different results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906843">Lastly, I want to focus on the issue of resources and building our resources out. Canada has the best innovation, labour and human rights standards in the world. We have the third-largest and fifth-largest reserves in the world. As long as legislation like Bill <Document DbId="9630600" Type="3">C-69</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="8936657" Type="3">C-48</Document> and the emissions cap exist, it will continue to limit and impede our ability to create the revenue we need to pay for the debt and deficit the government has not only accumulated over the last 10 years but also continues to accumulate going forward. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906844">We cannot keep attacking our energy sector. We have what the world needs. We have clean Canadian energy that we can feed the world. The problem we have right now, as long as these pieces of legislation exist, and as long as we continue with our emissions cap and an ideological attack on our energy sector, Canada is falling behind to a point where we are not going to supply the world, but we are actually going to enter into a supplementary mode. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906845">We can supply the world with clean Canadian energy, create billions and billions of dollars in revenue and great-paying jobs for our fellow Canadians, including indigenous Canadians, right across the country, yet this ideological attack continues and limits our ability to create these revenues. This will keep happening as long as we keep doing these things. This motion is calling for us to stop doing what we are doing, because it is not working. Canadians are paying the price every single day the government continues on the path it is on.</ParaText>

I am very much looking forward to listening to his speech.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906874">I have spent quite a bit of time in the chamber today, so I have had the opportunity to listen to what has been said. I must say that some of the stuff I have been hearing from the Conservatives is quite alarming and hypocritical and, quite frankly, does not make a lot of sense when we look at their actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906875">I will start with what we heard recently from the member for <Affiliation DbId="317669" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="317753" Type="2">Barrie South—Innisfil</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="317675" Type="2">Huron—Bruce</Affiliation> earlier. They all talked about inflationary spending. They suggested the government created the inflationary problem that the whole world has seen. The Government of Canada spent money and then the whole world saw inflation. That is what Conservatives would like us to believe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906876">What I find most ironic about that comment is that I am sure the member for <Affiliation DbId="318159" Type="2">Regina—Lewvan</Affiliation>, who was talking about me a few moments ago, and all members who have made comments are aware that they ran on a platform that had 106 billion dollars' worth of new spending in it. Are they now trying to say, indirectly, that their own platform was inflationary and was contributing to inflation? If I listen to what they are saying now, that is exactly what I am hearing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906877">It is more than that. I have been in this House long enough to have heard countless speeches, as I am sure the member for <Affiliation DbId="317964" Type="2">Whitby</Affiliation> has, from Conservatives who get up and say the carbon tax has contributed to inflation and the carbon tax is the reason food prices are higher right now. Over and over again, we have heard that. Let us just throw out the fact that Ukraine produces a third of the world's wheat and is in the middle of a war and that extracting all of that wheat from the global supply has a massive impact on inflation. Let us forget about all of that. It was the carbon tax. The Conservatives said that all we had to do was get rid of the carbon tax, and then suddenly inflation would disappear.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906878"> Well, guess what. The carbon tax is gone. Have all the prices the Conservatives said would drop instantly dropped? No, they have not, because it was not contributing to inflation. This is the exact same logic they are trying to apply now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906879">Earlier, I got a real kick out of the member for <Affiliation DbId="318006" Type="2">Calgary Crowfoot</Affiliation> talking about how the Conservatives are great fiscal stewards of the economy and the finances of the government and had left the new Liberal government in 2015 with an incredible surplus. It is as if he was trying to suggest that Conservatives know something about bringing in balanced budgets. They know absolutely nothing about it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906880">Let us go back. I will just talk about the preceding two Conservative governments. Brian Mulroney had 10 budgets, and he balanced zero. There were zero balanced budgets by Brian Mulroney. I understand that probably very few members of the Conservative Party were here when Brian Mulroney was here. There is at least one currently in the House right now, and that is great, but I will make this a little more relevant for some of the newer members who may have been here when Stephen Harper was here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906881">It is true that Stephen Harper had three surpluses out of the nine budgets he introduced in this House. Let us look at those budgets. The first two budgets were at the beginning of Stephen Harper's term, when he was first elected. He had a $13-billion surplus, but what is interesting is that the year before that, Paul Martin also had a $13-billion surplus. Stephen Harper actually inherited, from Paul Martin, a $13-billion surplus.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906882">Then in year two of Harper's government, he had a $9-billion surplus. It was on its way down. Then it vanished, and he was in a deficit position all the way through, right up until the last year when the Canadian Taxpayers Federation or some right-wing association told him it was absolutely imperative that he balance the budget. What did Stephen Harper do? He set out to balance the budget.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8906883">How did he do that? He did it by selling shares of GM at bargain prices. He slashed veterans' offices. For the first time in recorded Canadian history, our percentage of GDP invested in the military dropped below 1%. It has only ever existed below 1% for one year. That was in the year 2015, when it was at 0.96% of GDP. That is the legacy. That is the surplus. When the member for <Affiliation DbId="318006" Type="2">Calgary Crowfoot</Affiliation> comes in here and says that the Conservatives left a surplus, I guess they did, but they did it on the backs of Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906885">
                <B>Hon. Mark Gerretsen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe that. I just said they did it on the backs of Canadians, and at least four or five Conservatives started cheering and clapping. That just happened moments ago as I was standing here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906886">I have heard a lot of other misinformation in the time I have been sitting in the House today and listening to the debate. I heard a really interesting exchange. One thing the public does not get to see is the heckling that goes on back and forth. During a speech being given by the <Affiliation DbId="319393" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="317599" Type="2">Carlton Trail—Eagle Creek</Affiliation>, when the parliamentary secretary was talking about the Canada child benefit, yelled out that the Conservatives started it, that it was their program. Nothing could be further from the truth. What the Conservatives had under Stephen Harper was the universal child care benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906887"> What was the universal child care benefit? I am sure my Conservative colleagues here today are still extremely proud of that. They can go ahead and clap if they want, although I did not hear any claps there, which is interesting since I put them on the spot and offered them the floor to applaud. It gave the exact same amount of money for every child to every parent. That meant a millionaire got the exact same amount of money, because of course, the Conservatives would never want to miss an opportunity to send a cheque to a millionaire. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906888">What we did, which was truly transformative, was put in the Canada child care benefit so that millionaires and people who were extremely well off, those who did not need the cheque, did not receive the cheque. It gave us the ability to provide more to those who really needed it. I am bringing this up and spending time on it because there is a fundamental difference between government intervention by a Liberal and government intervention by a Conservative. Liberals believe in giving people opportunities so they can have the best shot.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906889">We talked about the national school food program. When there was an exchange going on, I heard the member for <Affiliation DbId="317599" Type="2">Carlton Trail—Eagle Creek</Affiliation> say that it was not working. She was heckling that. I can say that the Food Sharing Project in Kingston delivers food to schools throughout my entire riding and neighbouring ridings. As a matter of fact, a lot of the schools in the jurisdictions of the member for <Affiliation DbId="317936" Type="2">Lanark—Frontenac</Affiliation> and the member to the east of me, the member for <Affiliation DbId="317785" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands—Rideau Lakes</Affiliation>, receive food through its programs as well. I visited the Food Sharing Project and have seen exactly what it is and the impact that it has. This is not some imaginary bureaucracy; this is real. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906890">I will leave it at that. Once again, I have been subjected to a day of listening to the misinformation of the Conservatives, who are proclaiming that certain things exist and the reasons they exist, which are quite frankly not true. I hope I have contributed a bit of clarity today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906908">Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to follow what was a very good and entertaining, but obviously factual, speech from the member for Kingston and the Islands. It is great to be here to debate this afternoon.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906909">I understand that the members opposite are very eager to see our plan for growing the Canadian economy, so let me reassure them. On November 4, the government will table a historic budget that will both catalyze growth and outline our ambitious plan to refocus day-to-day spending and invest in the Canadian economy. Budget 2025 will build on our ongoing work that is focused on building a stronger economy and delivering for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906910">I would like to take a moment to highlight some of the important ways we are making life more affordable here at home, while ensuring that we are working to build an economy that will benefit Canadians for decades to come.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906911">As we all know, the global economy is undergoing a seismic shift, and there is no doubt that Canada must change with it. Canadians all across the country recognize this, which is why this past April they provided our government with a clear mandate to build a resilient and modern Canadian economy, the strongest in the G7.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906912">Bill <Document DbId="13539746" Type="3">C-4</Document> was one of the first bills introduced in the House, very soon after the House resumed. It was introduced by the <Affiliation DbId="318631" Type="4">Minister of Finance and National Revenue</Affiliation> in the spring. Bill C-4 received unanimous consent from the House. I recently said in the House that common sense seems to be lacking. It is not so common in the Conservative Party today, but common sense was provided at that moment, when Conservative members actually supported our tax cut bill, which is good news for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906913">I am a proud member of the finance committee. We are studying Bill <Document DbId="13539746" Type="3">C-4</Document> right now, and we look forward to the bill's getting speedy passage back to the House and receiving royal assent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906914">From a middle-class tax cut that is saving money for 22 million Canadians to eliminating the GST for first-time buyers on new homes up to $1 million and reducing the GST for first-time homebuyers on new homes between $1 million and $1.5 million, the legislation will put more money in Canadians' pockets. Canadians need that right now of course. These measures complement a whole package of other measures that were Liberal initiatives in the past Parliament, all of which were voted against by the Conservative Party, including dental care; child care; the Canada child benefit, which is indexed to inflation, by the way; the national school food program and many more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906915">There have also been other supports that our government has put in place under previous leadership in the past Parliament that reduced mortgage insurance, moved to 30-year mortgages and, again, offered tax-free savings accounts for first-time homebuyers. These measures, taken in context, complement a whole series of affordability measures that our government has put in place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906916">What is new is that the Conservatives actually supported Bill <Document DbId="13539746" Type="3">C-4</Document> and voted to get it through to committee. I hope that they will vote it through the House when it comes back from committee, hopefully soon. The other piece of Bill C-4 is to essentially remove from federal law the consumer fuel charge, which would essentially allow us to focus carbon pricing on large emitters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906917">Additionally, we continue to work diligently to address the housing crisis by focusing on driving down costs and making housing more affordable and accessible for Canadians. To this end, we recently launched Build Canada Homes, a new federal entity that will transform public-private collaboration and deploy modern methods of construction as it catalyzes the creation of entirely new Canadian housing industries from prefab to modular, to mass timber and to any other innovative method. I visited a group at York University that is 3-D printing three-storey homes, which was just incredible to see.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906918">Canada's innovation will lead the way. Build Canada Homes is part of our stepping up to support that industry. This critical tool will leverage public lands. It will offer flexible financial incentives to attract private capital, facilitate large portfolio projects and support modern manufacturers to build the homes that Canadians need.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8906919">It is not only the Canadian housing industry that we are transforming; we are also streamlining the federal approval process to get major projects built faster. For too long, the construction of major projects has been stalled by arduous and inefficient approval processes, leaving enormous investment on the table. The newly launched Major Projects Office will fast-track nation-building projects by streamlining regulatory assessment and approvals and will help to structure financing, all in close partnership with provinces, territories, indigenous peoples and private sector partners and investors. This in turn will create good-paying jobs for thousands of Canadians across this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906920">I remember when the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> first announced the launch of five major projects. What struck me that day was what the <Affiliation DbId="322132" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> said. He called those five major projects “pathetic”. He called tens of thousands of good-paying jobs for Canadians pathetic. He called 60 billion dollars' worth of economic activity in our economy pathetic. Members do not want to know what I think is pathetic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906921">Our government is moving with urgency and determination to build the strongest economy in the G7, but that urgency demands new ways of budget planning. That is exactly what we are doing. The <Affiliation DbId="318631" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> outlined recently a new way of budgeting, the cornerstone of which is a new capital budgeting framework that distinguishes and prioritizes spending that stimulates public sector and private sector capital investment versus day-to-day operational spending. This will mean more transparency in decision-making and more opportunity for stringency and scrutiny of taxpayer dollars allocated to investments that will grow Canada's economic potential. This follows many G7 countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906922">Going forward, the government will also adopt a fall budget cycle starting with budget 2025. The fall timing, which is before the main estimates, will facilitate the oversight and study of public expenditure for parliamentarians, inherently making the process more transparent. It will also support effective financial planning for federal departments and agencies and for provinces and territories, as well as for Canadian businesses, allowing for more informed decision-making on where public funds will have the most impact.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906923">The updated budget cycle will also closely align with the construction season and provide increased certainty and predictability for businesses and investors, giving builders and investors a real head start. The new fall budget will be followed by a spring economic fiscal update as the new fiscal year begins, as well as pre-budget consultations over the course of the summer, allowing for ample time to build a budget that fully reflects the current needs of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906924">Before I conclude, I would like to take a minute to highlight Canada's fiscal advantage and how we stack up against G7 countries. In 2024, Canada's net debt-to-GDP ratio stood at just 11.9%, compared to the G7 average, excluding Canada, at 100.4%. That is 11% compared to 100%. In fact, Canada's net debt burden remains lower today than that of any G7 country prior to the pandemic. Canada is also expected to have had the smallest deficit in the G7 as a share of the economy this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906925">Canada's fiscal position also stands out among a broader set of 30 advanced economies, posting deficit and net debt-to-GDP ratios among the lowest in the group. This marks a sharp contrast with Canada's fiscal situation in the 1980s and early 1990s, when sustained deficits led to a rapid rise in the net debt burden and an erosion of Canada's fiscal advantage relative to its peers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906926">Canada is also one of only two G7 economies, along with Germany, to have a AAA rating from at least two of the three major global credit rating agencies. Our AAA credit rating helps maintain investors' confidence and keeps Canada's borrowing costs as low as possible. Canada has a lower interest rate on debt than the United States has, which I would say is noteworthy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906927">Budget 2025 will highlight how all our actions are guided by a new fiscal discipline. We will spend less to invest more. I know that is hard for Conservatives to understand, but spending less on government operations allows us fiscal room to invest more and to attract private capital, playing the catalytic role in our economy that the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has talked about over and over again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906928">That is how to produce and create a virtuous cycle between investment and growth in the economy, which will increase tax revenues in the future and allow us to sustain many of the social programs and gains we have made under previous Liberal governments that we will need in order to have the fiscal room to continue to support. This is why we have initiated a comprehensive expenditure review to ensure that we get the most out of every Canadian dollar.</ParaText>

Between the kitchen and the food bank, the Agapè Centre processed a million pounds of food for those in need, with a value of $3.6 million.

Food inflation is 70% above where the target inflation rate should be, and Canadians are going to be spending an extra $800 on groceries as a family this year. That is the expected average, with no relief in sight.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906949">One of the things we know and have been saying for years, which continues to be shown with higher food inflation, higher housing prices and higher deficits, is that those higher deficits and money printing lead to inflation and lead to that pressure. It is not sustainable, what we have seen for the last number of years under the Liberals, and we are seeing that live in living colour through the sad reality of one food bank in Cornwall alone.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906950">A key part of any government in order to be successful, to grow the economy and to have a sustainable future is getting investment in this country. From what we have seen, the numbers speak for themselves. Since the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> came into office, we have seen $54 billion in investment leave this country for the United States. Over the course of the last five years, that number has been half a trillion dollars. Why?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906951">It is the lack of good management from the Liberals to create an economic environment through good taxes, good opportunities for jobs, and an atmosphere so that businesses want to bring direct foreign investment from around the world into Canada. We have seen half a billion dollars leave Canada for the United States because that is where they prefer to do business.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906952">As if that rate continuing for the next five years was not bad enough, this week when the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> visited Washington, there was another major concession with no deal. He has already conceded on countertariffs and the digital services tax, and then he said in his comments in the Oval Office of the White House that he would pledge, as some sort of deal they are working on, $1 trillion of Canadian investment money to go to the United States in the next five years. That is double the rate we have already lost. That is absolutely ridiculous. It is an absolute betrayal of Canadians and Canadian workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906953">What does that mean? That is $1 trillion the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> put on the table with nothing in return, except for those dollars being used in the United States. Just imagine if those one trillion Canadian dollars were invested in Canada in the next five years instead, but no.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906954">We are going to see a factory either closed in Ontario or, if a brand-new one will be built, it will not be built in Ontario but rather in the state of Michigan or Ohio. With the red tape of regulations, it takes 25 years in many cases to get a permit for a mine in northern Ontario, B.C. or other parts of this country. As opposed to seeing that investment and jobs created in British Columbia, as an example, or northern Ontario, it will be going to West Virginia or Washington. For someone with dollars in Canada, as opposed to opening up a new business in, say, Nova Scotia, they will open up in the state of Maine instead. This will happen at a time when we can least afford it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906955">As the official opposition, we have a responsibility to hold the government to account. The <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that he was going to create new jobs in Canada. Since he became Prime Minister, 86,000 jobs have been lost, including in the city of Cornwall, with Ridgewood Industries closing and 300 jobs gone in our community just in the last couple of months. This is not sustainable, but over and over again, we see the Liberal government repeating the same failed approaches.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906956">We are now seeing the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> going out and openly advocating and creating deals with the United States, with nothing in return, that are going to see $1 trillion in Canadian investment money leave our country and flow down south.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906957">The <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> knows that very well, because he did that just before he became Prime Minister, when he was the chair of Brookfield. Brookfield is part of that $500 billion of Canadian money I mentioned that moved to the United States in the last five years. The Prime Minister's own company, Brookfield, was one of those. It moved its headquarters to New York City, leading by example in completely the wrong way.</ParaText>

The deficits are at least double what Justin Trudeau's deficits were going to be, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906978">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise in the House. I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906979">For 10 years now, the Liberal government has made our country weaker with overspending and deficit after deficit. Through the Liberal government, the promotion of government dependency in regard to economic development has become the staple and the identity of Canada, especially in indigenous economic development.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906980">The current projection for the Liberal government deficit, for this year alone, is anywhere from $60 billion to $100 billion. Indigenous peoples and Canadians have questions. Why is it that the government, year after year, gets to spend recklessly and go billions and billions over budget, with little to no plan when, through the Indian Act and Indigenous Services Canada, it enforces financial and management penalties if first nations go over budget?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906981">Why is it that first nations have default and third party management enforced on them for one challenging fiscal year, but the Liberal government gets to put Canada in debt to the tune of trillions of dollars and have billions of dollars in annual deficits? Maybe the government, led by the supposedly brilliant banker, should be subject to the same penalties it enforces upon first nations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906982">It seems to be rules for thee, not for me, when it comes to the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906983">The deficits have cost 86,000 net job losses alone in our country. Indigenous unemployment and youth unemployment have combined to exclude an entire generation of young indigenous workers from contributing to Canada's economy. Deficits hurt community workers, frontline workers, teachers and health aides.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906984">First nations communities see their pay stagnate while living costs soar. Just as the rest of rural Canada does, we already struggle to recruit teachers, social workers, health care workers and other frontline staff needed in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906985"> Ottawa's reckless spending does not lift up indigenous workers. It pushes them out of the workforce through affordability pressures and housing shortages.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906986">Indigenous Canadian unemployment is exacerbated by the Liberal mismanagement of immigration and temporary foreign workers. For years, we have had workers in the indigenous communities wanting their chance to contribute to local economies in rural Canada and urban centres, but they feel left out and forgotten because of Liberal mismanagement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906987">It is time to put Canada first. Canadians are scared; they are scared about job losses and how they are going to put food on the table and pay the bills. Food inflation above the Bank of Canada's target is not abstract. It means $15 milk in northern community stores, families choosing between gas and groceries and higher costs for traditional foods and supplies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906988">People accessing rural grocery stores were hit hard with both rising food costs and the cost of fuel to get them to and from their reserve communities. Rising fuel and transportation costs erode band budgets, forcing leaders to cut community programs or delay infrastructure maintenance. Rising costs force chiefs and councils to choose between health care and social supports. This has exacerbated housing shortages and lack of access to clean drinking water, as well as increasing maintenance costs for public service vehicles and preventable costs for indigenous communities, which Canadians continue to pay for later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906989">Increased costs of living hit indigenous post-secondary students hard, with increased costs to study and increased costs for housing, for travel and to meet cultural and family obligations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906990">Indigenous students are a part of the record line-ups at food banks. The treaty right to education funding has been watered down under the Liberal government. These are our future leaders, but they are falling behind the rest of Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906991">Indigenous communities continue to struggle in the Liberal deficit environment to create and sustain their own-source revenue initiatives today. When the dollar weakens and borrowing costs rise, first nations own-source revenues and trust funds lose value. Inflation cancels out indigenous progress. Every gain from new businesses, trading programs and economic partnerships is swallowed by higher costs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906992">Local indigenous entrepreneurs are priced out of equipment loans and procurement opportunities. Youth training programs face cost overruns with no adjustment in funding, and $53.9 billion leaving Canada for the United States means fewer partnerships for indigenous-led projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906993">Energy, food security, natural resources, mines, operations and tourism ventures struggle to attract investors.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8906994">Real reconciliation requires capital staying in Canada to grow indigenous economies, not capital fleeing and the government trying to play hero by making federal tax dollars the focus for economic development in our communities. Indigenous nations want the government to get out of the way so that we can create our own economies alongside the rest of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906995">Ottawa's deficits raise interest rates, which raise borrowing costs for first nations and indigenous development corporations, making self-financing more challenging or near impossible. The promise of reconciliation through economic inclusion rings hollow when inflation eats away at every grant dollar and makes indigenous infrastructure 30% to 40% more expensive to build. What indigenous prosperity needs instead is fiscal discipline that makes every dollar count; targeted investments, not blanket deficits; stable inflation, so indigenous nations can plan multi-year infrastructure builds without surprise cost escalations; true partnerships in which indigenous communities direct investment to local priorities and not to Ottawa's vote-buying announcements; and economic reconciliation grounded in accountability, stability and productivity, not recycled Liberal talking points.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906996">The traditions of first nations people often centre on not taking more than what one needs, not wasting one part of the buffalo or the moose that we hunt to sustain us. That is sustainability. This aligns with the principle of balancing our budget and eliminating our deficits. This aligns with our values as indigenous people. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906997">When I became chief of my nation, oil prices were down, which affected our local economy. We projected an $8-million deficit, or 10% overspending, for my first nation alone. We had overdependence on band office jobs. We had very little in terms of external investment confidence in our Enoch Cree Nation. We knew we had to make tough fiscal decisions and really do the work to restore investor confidence and our membership confidence to have good governance in our first nation and have a real plan to grow and diversify our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906998"> Therefore, we created our first financial law, which holds our Enoch government accountable for how it spends. We made ourselves investable again, which resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in economic development on and off our reserve for our members and for Albertans. We invested in our natural resource sector and partnered to build the first greenfield large-scale natural gas power plant in a generation in Alberta. We grew business and entrepreneurship; we focused less on government-dependent jobs, and we became stronger. We readily partner with other first nations and indigenous communities to make everybody else stronger as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8906999">The government talks about “Canada strong”, but I think the Liberals really need to reflect on the fact that deficits make Canada weaker. We think in terms of seven generations in our indigenous communities. The current government seems to be adding seven generations' worth of debt and burden to all Canadians in the future.</ParaText>

It is humiliating for first nations, and sometimes humility is part of what we are as first nations.</ParaText>

Sovereignty would not be harmed, and we would be on the path to prosperity.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8907018">Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to participate in today's opposition motion debate. I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="317797" Type="2">London West</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907019">The global economy has changed, and Canada must change too. We need to build more housing and infrastructure and support industries that are essential to our economic growth. This spring, Canadians called for a serious and ambitious plan, and we are working hard to prepare and implement that plan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907020">First, our colleague the <Affiliation DbId="318631" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has already announced that our new government will table the 2025 budget on November 4. Second, as he outlined this week, the budget will be based on a new capital investment budgeting framework. This framework will distinguish between current operating expenditure and capital investments, which will help the government prioritize investments that will deliver long-term benefits for Canada and Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907021"> The operating expenditure will be balanced by 2028-29. The 2025 budget will rise to the occasion. It will be a budget to build the strongest economy in the G7 and a budget to build a strong and free Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907022">The 2025 budget will do something else that is very concrete. It will make life more affordable for Canadians. We understand that the cost of living remains a constant concern for Canadians. We have already announced several measures to help them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907023">We know that one of the challenges is the cost of housing. We are facing a housing crisis, which is why we are implementing an ambitious new approach to increase the supply of housing in Canada. For example, the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> recently launched a new federal agency responsible for building affordable housing on a large scale, which is called Build Canada Homes. With Build Canada Homes, we will combat homelessness by building supervised and transitional housing in collaboration with provinces, territories, municipalities and indigenous communities. This agency will build community-based, highly affordable housing for low-income households and will partner with private developers to build affordable housing for the country's middle class. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907024">To help Canadians buy homes, we proposed eliminating the GST for first-time buyers of new homes valued at $1 million or less and reducing the GST for first-time buyers of new homes valued between $1 million and $1.5 million. Furthermore, as Canadians demanded, we put money back in the pockets of all Canadians by cutting taxes. Since July 1, all Canadians have benefited from a tax cut that will save a dual-income family up to $840 per year starting in 2026. I am proud to note that 22 million Canadians will benefit from this tax relief. They can now keep more of their paycheques and use them according to their priorities, as they wish.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907025">In these times of trade tension with the United States, we understand the importance of continuing to support Canadians affected by this dispute. Since the beginning of the trade dispute, we have put in place a robust Canadian system of economic support programs to help businesses and workers directly affected by U.S. tariffs. For example, we have temporarily suspended the one-week waiting period for employment insurance benefits, and we have temporarily suspended the rules surrounding the processing of severance pay to prevent workers from having to exhaust their severance pay before receiving the employment insurance benefit. We have made it easier to access employment insurance by increasing the unemployment rate applied to regions for a period of six months. We have also made it easier for employers and workers affected by tariffs to access the work-sharing program. Employers experiencing a decline in business activity due to the threat or potential implementation of tariffs may be eligible for special measures under the work-sharing program.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907026">Our new government has also announced a series of targeted measures to support Canada's steel, aluminum and softwood lumber industries. For example, our government will invest $70 million in labour market development agreements with provinces and territories to provide training and income support measures to nearly 10,000 affected steelworkers. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8907027">We are also implementing new measures to help the lumber industry transform and compete. We are providing up to $700 million in loan guarantees to alleviate the current pressure on the lumber sector, and we are building with a focus on using Canadian materials in construction. We have changed the federal contracting processes to require companies that contract with the federal government to source Canadian lumber. In this way, our government is ensuring that Canadian workers benefit from our investments during these challenging times.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907028">The 2025 budget will be a generational investment in our future, and with it, we will build a Canada of the 21st century. This budget will set out a clear plan to build the strongest economy in the G7, based on generational investments in housing and infrastructure, while reducing the cost of living for Canadians. It will stimulate private investments here in Canada and strengthen our ties with trusted trading partners and allies, moving our economy from reliant to resilient. At the same time, the government will exercise new fiscal discipline in its day-to-day operations to make services more efficient and reliable, while focusing resources on long-term growth to ensure Canada's prosperity today and for decades to come.</ParaText>

The Darlington project is being touted as proof that the government is bringing economic benefit to Canada, but that project, to build an SMR, a so-called small modular reactor, if completed, will be the first one in North America. They are not operating anywhere. Well, they operate in China and Russia, but commercially, not in North America.

              <ParaText id="8907087">If capital can be considered water, then Canada is a leaky bucket. Our foreign direct investment, FDI, is the directional flow of this water. FDI coming in is the total inflow of capital from the world to Canada, and FDI going out is the total outflow of capital to the world from Canada. If we subtract the inflow from the outflow, we get our net FDI, or the level of water in our bucket.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907088">The Canadian bucket has been leaking every year from 2015 to 2024 under the Liberal government. Rounding solely to the nearest billion, these are the quick stats for the net outflow each year, all negative: 2015 was $30 billion, 2016 was $44 billion, 2017 was $69 billion, 2018 was $26 billion, 2019 was $36 billion, 2020 was $24 billion, 2021 was $56 billion, 2022 was $50 billion, 2023 was $63 billion and 2024 was $40 billion. From 2015 to 2024, this equates to negative $437 billion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907089">Do we even have a bucket here, or is this a pipeline of our capital being pumped directly to other countries under a decade of Liberal loss? Let us discuss the cause of these leaks. When the outflow FDI from Canada consistently exceeds the inflow, it means that Canadian capital is finding better opportunities abroad than foreign capital is finding in Canada. This means we need more domestic projects with streamlined regulations to retain our leaky capital.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907090">Our domestic market is small, with only about 40 million people dispersed across a land mass that is second only to Russia in size. This already means that our firms cannot completely rely on domestic consumption. It already means that the only way we compete internationally is through exports. It already means that the only decision in the mind of our firms is whether they can build in Canada and ship to external markets or whether they set up production internationally to sell internationally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907091">We need incentivizing structures to make it easier to launch massive projects in Canada around energy, infrastructure and manufacturing. These projects would give our economic actors reasons to keep their capital within our borders. However, the Liberals want to make it hard to build in Canada. Our reputation is ruined for investors with multiple failed projects like northern gateway or energy east.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907092">The Liberals want carbon pricing. The Liberals want environmental, social and governance, ESG, reporting requirements on everything. The Liberals want impact assessments over and over again, barriers upon barriers. The Liberals do not want us to build. They do not want us to be industrialized. The Liberals want to drive us back to the Stone Age, where we can frolic in fields, beset by poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907093">We only need to look at current stats to see the road to poverty that is being paved for us by Liberal intentions. Since the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was sworn in, in March, 86,000 Canadians have lost their job, Canada has the second-highest unemployment rate in the G7 and food inflation is double the Bank of Canada's target rate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907094">I came across an interesting definition of the west: western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic. When we take away our industrialization, we lose what makes us rich and what enables us to be educated. We often find in cities that universities emerge only after the city has undergone an industrial and commercial build-out. There is no true mass democracy without a mass society fostered through the foundation of industrial wealth.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8907095">When too much capital leaves Canada because of anti-growth Liberal policies, will Canada still be a western nation? The Conservatives want to stop these capital leaks. The overarching vision is very simple: Retain more of our domestic capital and attract more foreign capital. Another way to look at this is when we have more water than our bucket can contain. Imagine that our bucket is no longer leaking, but that it is very small. This small bucket could not contain the $437 billion of outflow that exited our bucket over the last 10 years under the Liberal government. Building a bigger, capital-retaining bucket means having cities where we can deposit our capital for an expected return. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907096">As I mentioned before, let us focus on energy, infrastructure and manufacturing. If we cannot create a policy environment where it is easy for major projects to be set up in Canada, these major projects will be set up outside of our borders. Along with these out-going projects will be the jobs that should have existed for Canadians. There is no other way for us to make meaningful moves within the parliamentary cycle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907097">I have one additional point that relates to manufacturing, and I will relate it through an analogy. All things being equal, do we want to be grape sellers or wine sellers? Speaking broadly, Canada is very used to being a seller of grapes throughout our distinguished history. However, if we want to retain more capital within our borders, we need to do more of the venture-added processing work, which would behoove us to have a stronger domestic production build out. From an industrial policy standpoint, this means selling less of our resources raw, investing in more production capacity for the resources that we have in abundance and ensuring that we have end markets for our value-added products, otherwise this export strategy all falls apart. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907098">Let us recall that, first, if we do not do this ourselves within our borders, it means that our capital will find itself investing in production facilities within the end market destinations. Second, our roughly 40-million person market across a vast land mass is not enough to serve our total pool of capital. Finally, an export-oriented strategy built upon the foundation of energy, infrastructure and manufacturing projects may be one of the few ways to reserve our flows of capital from a federal policy standpoint under the consideration of a parliamentary cycle.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907099">Absent our capacity to retain our capital through policy levers at the federal level, we risk becoming a nation of fields to frolic in, beset by poverty in a post-industrial wasteland that the Rust Belt knows only too well. Perhaps we will then come to rely solely on tourism to our green society, and guess where our tourists will come from? They will come from industrialized societies producing wealthy citizens, uninhibited by carbon pricing, ESG reporting requirements and impact assessments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907100">Every dollar that leaves the country means lower wages and lost jobs for workers. We Conservatives call on the Liberals to stop driving investment and jobs down and the cost of living up.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8907116">Before I get into the substance of my speech, it is really important, whenever we talk about anything that has to deal with the state of the economy in Canada, that we point out the total number of debt in Canada. Right now, Canada's federal debt is $1,276,208,890,000. Now it is $891,000, $892,000, $893,000. I cannot even read the hundreds and the cents because it is going up way too fast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907117">The share of federal debt for each and every person in the House and every single Canadian is $30,457. The growth in Canada's debt per day, without the government introducing any new spending, is $109,863,013.70. That is every single day without the government doing anything. When the Liberals start pouring more inflationary spending on the fire, imagine how that number will be impacted and how it will change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907118">Those are the numbers that every single member of this House should be paying more attention to. If they did, they would understand them, particularly those on the government side. On this side, we pay attention to those numbers a lot. The government needs to pay attention to them, because then it would finally start to understand why we talk so much about the negative impact on the economy of the way the Liberals have been steering things. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907119">I want to give people a bit of a history lesson. I am from Saskatchewan, born and raised. I grew up on a farm outside of a small town. The prairie economy back in the day was based on a couple of things. The most common thing was the rail line. When we look at where all the different communities across southwest and west central Saskatchewan are, they are generally in relation to either the current national rail line or the many offshoot rail lines. Some rail lines are no longer in existence and have been removed, but we can see the communities that used to exist along those rail lines. Some of those communities, unfortunately, have vanished or are vanishing because of the state of the economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907120">The reason I bring this is up is that there used to be, out in the Prairies in particular, very individual, localized economies. If we look at the jobs numbers, 86,000 jobs were lost in Canada recently under the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. These small local economies used to provide a lot of jobs. In just about every single small town along the rail line, farming was obviously the driver of the local economy, but within the local, siloed economy, there were farmers, a blacksmith, sometimes two or three equipment dealers selling farm implements and a couple of different auto dealers selling cars and trucks. They also had schools and hospitals. They had a heavy focus on the local economy, so there were always lots of jobs for folks in these small towns.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907121">If we fast-forward, our rural communities have been decimated. We can look on Google Maps and zoom in and look at the roads. This is true for many members in the House, from Saskatchewan, from Alberta and from all across the country. In my riding in particular, I have well over 100 communities, and several of them are small in size for sure, but they are just as important as any of the larger communities, like the city of Swift Current, and, when we look nationally, some of the large cities, like Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. These small towns are extremely important. Why is that? For starters, agriculture represents one in eight jobs in the national economy, and we can break that down into the various portions of agriculture. The canola industry, for example, impacts GDP and the Canadian economy more than the auto industry does. That is how big and important the agriculture sector, even just the canola industry, let alone the entire agriculture sector, is to the prairie economy. I want people to know that off the top.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8907122">That gets to some of the current Liberal policies that are driving the cost of living crisis and chasing jobs out of Canada. We have things like the industrial carbon tax, the incoming Liberal fuel standard that is a second carbon tax and the emissions cap, and everybody knows about the failed Impact Assessment Act and the tanker ban. These are all largely detrimental policies for rural Canada, but they have a trickle impact into urban Canada because everything that exists in urban Canada originated from rural Canada, first and foremost. Whether it is food, building materials or the energy used to heat and cool homes, it all originated in rural Canada. It is important for people in the House to know and understand that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907123">I do not think that western Canada, particularly my riding, when we look at the way it was settled, would have developed the way it did if the Liberals of the day had had the same types of laws we see today, with the industrial carbon tax and things like that, which I listed earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907124">I want to share a quick story. Before we came back from summer break, I met with some seniors. He is 90 and she is 80. He is a retired farmer, and she worked in the service industry most of her life. One would never know it by looking at them; they do not look a day over 60. It is quite remarkable. People who work hard live long and prosperous lives. However, they have gotten to a point in their lives where they are not able to find work. No one is going to hire them, but when someone is 90 or 80, they should not be thinking about how they are going to work to put food on the table. They have a fixed income, and they are at a point in their lives where they have had to take a mortgage out on the house they have, just to be able to afford the basic necessities of life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907125">When I went and met with them, they had not run their air conditioning all summer, they did not have any lights on in their house and they told me they are not going to turn the furnace on until they absolutely have to. They had not eaten beef or even knew how long it had been since they had been able to go out and buy a roast, some steaks or things like that. They talked to me about how the food that they are eating is perilous, that their diet is going down the drain. It is actually leading to bad health outcomes for them because, again, they are 90 and 80.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907126">She is doing everything she can to make home-cooked meals with the limited resources she has. When we look at the cost of groceries, it has gotten out of hand to the point that they are not even able to afford a roast anymore. She is really struggling to make things go. When I was there, she had loaves of bread set out that she had made because someone had given her the raw products needed to mill her own homemade bread, so that is a staple in their diet. It is homemade, so that is good. In the same breath, when they go out with $100 to the grocery store, for two people, that should be able to get them through a week and into a second week with no problem, but it does not. It barely gets people through a couple of days. Their budget only goes so far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907127">At the age they are at, they have medications that they have to buy. They still have a vehicle, but they do not drive it because they cannot afford to put gas in it. They cannot do the things that most people do when they retire with their grandkids. For example, they cannot take them on trips, to the hockey rink or for supper. It is hard for them to be able to do any of those because, quite frankly, they literally cannot afford it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907128">This is a farmer who has worked hard his entire life. He is a very proud man. This lady worked in the service industry helping people, including seniors, and also worked with adults with disabilities, one of the most noble things a person can do. Now they can hardly even afford to feed themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907129">That is why we have this motion in front of us here today: to get the government to focus on Canadians. We heard the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> today talk about $1 trillion being invested, if he gets the right deal, in the United States, and he is saying that it is private money. That is the whole point. Private companies should be investing in Canada, and the Prime Minister's goal should be to get that investment in Canada to fix our economy and create jobs so that the cost of living will not impact people like this family has been impacted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907130">It is embarrassing and the government needs to reverse course. It should adopt our motion. </ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8907151">Mr. Speaker, I want to pursue a question that I first asked on June 17 of this year. Looking at the reality that we have not had a budget yet, but will see soon, we have been told that we are going to see massive increases in military spending.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907152">The point of my question was to ask if we were not aware that geopolitical security does not necessarily come from arming ourselves to the teeth but to prepare to wage peace, to be prepared to hold peace in areas that have been conflict zones and, even more importantly, perhaps long term, to ensure we address the climate crisis and that we are prepared to increase our humanitarian spending in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907153">The reason I raised this, and raise it again tonight, is due to the answer I received, of course. It revealed a lot about the new government's commitment to international development. Had I asked this question before the election, there would have been a minister responsible for international development who could have responded, but in this new cabinet, there is no minister responsible for international development. There is the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="318153" Type="2">Surrey Centre</Affiliation>, who is the Secretary of State for International Development. Certainly that is a responsibility, but he does not have the same degree of clout around the cabinet table because he is not seated there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907154">The reality of our current situation globally is that the world is in what the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> calls a “hinge moment”. It is certainly in crisis. The old order of things that we once thought we could take for granted has certainly been upended by the actions of the U.S. president. He is erratic, unpredictable and withdrawing from multilateralism. He is even withdrawing from the kind of multilateralism of international trade deals respecting the general agreement on tariffs and trade, the GATT from post Second World War. He has withdrawn from numerous global organizations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907155">That not only cuts into humanitarian assistance but also reorders the world in ways that can be quite dangerous as, for instance, when the United States withdraws from UN agencies, it opens up space for the People's Republic of China to move in. The People's Republic of China already owns much of Africa. When we look at the global south, we want the influence of democratic nations that hold human rights and free speech dear, recognizing that we cannot allow women and girls around the world to go uneducated and expect to have a stable world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907156">The United States has withdrawn from the World Health Organization. That clearly means the world is going to see more millions of people at risk of tuberculosis, of malaria and of HIV/AIDS. The U.S. has cancelled its entire USAID program. Where is Canada? Can we step up and fill the gap?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907157">I mentioned that we do not have a minister for international development right now. It was Lester B. Pearson who, after he was prime minister, headed up a UN agency and said that we were going to target 0.7% of our GNI all around the world to international development assistance. That target, known as the Pearson target, has been more than met by quite a number of our European allies who have hit more than 1% of their GNI going to overseas development assistance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907158">Where is Canada? How close are we to our 0.7% target? We are just about halfway. We are at 0.34%. We are laggards in the world of international development assistance. We rate 15th, but that is a better record than where we rate for donating and helping peacekeeping operations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8907160">I really appreciate the concern raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="317902" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>, whom I respect tremendously, regarding Canada's commitment to international development assistance. This is an important issue that speaks directly to Canada's role in the global community.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907161"> First, let me emphasize that our government recognizes that peace is achieved in a multi-faceted way, through a combination of development, diplomacy and defence. We know that poverty, failed states and fragile governance are root causes of conflict and terrorism.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907162">Canadian development assistance helps address these issues and is an essential component of promoting global security and keeping Canadians safe. It is a key pillar of our foreign policy.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8907163"> At a time when democracy and human rights are under threat around the world and our partners are looking to build prosperous economies by fighting climate change, our government remains committed to international aid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907164"> We continue to promote development, support vulnerable communities and contribute to democratic governance. These commitments are critical to fostering peace and prosperity.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8907165">At the same time, we face a complex and evolving global landscape that demands a thoughtful and nuanced approach to strengthening Canada's security. Meeting the NATO defence spending target is not just a commitment; it is a necessity at this time. In an era marked by shifting global dynamics, as the member alluded to herself, and renewed threats to our sovereignty, the challenges we face are urgent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907166">It is vital to ensure that Canada is prepared to defend our people, our values and our sovereignty and to protect our partners worldwide. This does not negate in any way our commitment to international development assistance and poverty reduction. In fact, this commitment is essential to peace and prosperity both here at home and around the world. International development assistance helps partner countries respond to global threats and strengthen their economies to contribute to a more secure and prosperous world for all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907167">Official development assistance and our defence spending are not mutually exclusive. Our government remains responsive to global needs and continues to invest in programs that address the root causes of conflict and instability. This includes support for areas like humanitarian assistance, gender equality, good governance, climate action, education, global health and, of course, economic growth.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907168">We also work to ensure the transparency and accountability of international assistance to deliver measurable, optimized results. By prioritizing effectiveness and measurable results, as well as our partners' own priorities, we continue to focus on having a real and lasting impact in the places we work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907169">Finally, our government is actively pursuing innovative partnerships and mechanisms with other countries, international organizations and the private sector to make the most of our resources. The moment we live in demands that kind of multi-faceted approach, and that is exactly what Canada is pursuing.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8907174">Mr. Speaker, working families across Canada are struggling. Half of all Canadians are living paycheque to paycheque. The cost of essentials is climbing, and our economy is on the verge of recession. Unemployment is at its highest level in a decade, with young people hit hardest. One in six youth is out of work, with many more underemployed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907175">At the same time, Donald Trump's trade war continues to hurt Canadian workers and undermine our economic stability. Instead of putting forward real solutions, the Liberal government is planning an austerity budget. The Liberals want to cut services Canadians rely on and the good jobs that go with them, all to meet an arbitrary 15% target that puts neo-liberal ideology over common sense. They want to vastly increase military spending on things like Donald Trump's golden dome and expand fossil fuel infrastructure to the U.S. instead of investing in the productive and sustainable sectors that Canada needs for a prosperous future.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907176">We think that is the wrong approach. New Democrats believe that now is the time for investment, in our communities, in our businesses, in our workforce and in our infrastructure. We believe that Canadians need bold action to strengthen our economy, create good jobs, build affordable homes and improve our public health care system. That means supporting technology and research, getting more value from our raw resources, developing sustainable industries and building infrastructure that improves people's lives, with Canadian labour, Canadian materials and Canadian companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907177">Canada has an infrastructure deficit approaching $300 billion. There is no shortage of excellent projects that we can all agree are much-needed, things like modern and clean electricity grids, efficient public transit systems, community health care clinics and quality long-term care centres. Let us join together and start to construct these nation-building projects.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907178">We are painfully aware that Canada has a severe housing crisis. Rents have more than doubled since 2015. Home ownership is out of the question for far too many Canadians. This crisis stems from decades of policy failure. It is clear that the private market cannot adequately meet the needs of low- and middle-income earners, yet only 3.5% of Canada's housing stock is non-market, far below the OECD average of 7%.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907179">A secure, affordable home is the foundation of every Canadian's ability to function well in our society. New Democrats believe that the federal government has a critical role to play in ensuring that everyone has a decent place to call home. That is why it must take the lead in dramatically scaling up the construction of non-market housing of all types, including co-op, student, senior and supportive housing. It needs to start now, in the upcoming budget.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907180">Canadians are also acutely aware that our public health care system is under serious strain. Millions of folks do not have a family doctor, wait times are growing and health care workers are burning out. Public health care is more than a service. It is a nation-building project. It is the heart of our national identity because it reflects our shared commitment to care for one another.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907181">This is more than just a moral imperative. It is also an economic one. A healthy economy needs healthy workers. It is time to strengthen and expand our public health care system, not maintain the status quo. That means improving access to care, delivering universal public pharmacare and supporting our Canadian dental care plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907182">Will the Liberals deliver a budget that invests in people, or will they choose austerity, service cuts and job losses instead?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8907184">I want to assure the hon. member and all colleagues that we share his concern, and I will point to the plan we have and the array of programs we put together to build a skilled workforce for the future.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8907185">That is why we are working hard with employers, service providers and trade unions to ensure that our young people have the skills and job opportunities they need to enter the labour market.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8907186">Many Canadians share the priorities that the member opposite raised about investing in communities and infrastructure, about investing in people and in our workforce, and certainly about investing in and protecting public health care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907187">I want to pick up on this issue of youth employment, and I want to talk a little about some of the programs we have put in place to help build that workforce for the future. As we proceed as a government to investment in major projects, as we proceed to invest in programs like Build Canada Homes, which is going to see an investment in affordable housing on a scale we have not seen since the Second World War, the one shared constant is that we are going to need the people and the talent to help us achieve these goals and to help us build the projects and the homes we need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907188">It starts with young people. It starts with education and training. It starts with programs like Canada summer jobs, which has a proven track record. Since 2019, it has provided more than half a million young people with summer jobs. Last year an audit of the CSJ program by the Auditor of General of Canada found that participants in Canada summer jobs benefit from better long-term earnings than non-participants. Our government added an additional 6,000 summer job opportunities this past summer, and 70,000 jobs are already planned for this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907189">However, we go beyond this. We are supporting approximately 160,000 opportunities for youth and students through the youth employment and skills strategy, or YESS, which includes Canada summer jobs, the student work placement program, the supports for student learning program and the Canada service corps. This year the YESS program delivered, in collaboration with 12 departments and agencies, job supports and skills development opportunities to more than 20,000 youth. These interventions work. An estimated 73% of young Canadian emerge from the YESS program employed or returning to school.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907190">Picking up on the member's point about trades workers, right now in Canada over half a million skilled trades workers are on track to retire by 2031. This represents a massive challenge that needs both immediate and long-term solutions. We are going to need tens of thousands of skilled trades workers to build our country, to help solve our housing crisis and to deliver the major projects we are setting out to build. It is why the Government of Canada is investing nearly $1 billion each year to support skilled trades apprentices. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907191">I have been to those training centres. I have spoken with trades programs. I have spoken with the Canadian Apprenticeship Forum. The return on investment for every dollar we invest in apprenticeships for trades generates $1.83 back to our economy. These are important programs and services. Along with the Canadian apprenticeship strategy, which offers financial supports for apprentices to encourage their certification in the skilled trades, we can help build the workforce we are going to need for the future.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8907201">Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, we will see the latest job numbers from Statistics Canada. It is important to underline the magnitude of the challenge confronting people of all ages, but particularly young people. The unemployment rate has gone up to 7.1%. It has been continually increasing for years, ever since the end of COVID. Youth unemployment has hit 14.5%, which is already at recession levels. In just the last month, we saw a 12% increase in EI claims among working-age women. In the last Statistics Canada job numbers, if we include self-employed people, we had over 100,000 job losses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907202">It is important to look squarely at this data and say that the government's approach is failing badly when it comes to jobs. We are going to hear in this exchange, as we have, the government congratulating itself for various programs. However, we actually need to see changes in policy that change the result. The intentions of politicians do not matter to Canadians; what matters to Canadians is whether they have a job. Jobs for young people are of critical importance. They set people up on a track to build a career for the future. If they miss those critical early milestones because of a bad economy that hurts young people, it will have an impact that lasts throughout their life.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907203">The Liberal <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised to change from the approach taken by his Liberal predecessor, but unfortunately, we have seen the continuation of bad policies and a continuation of the trajectory on unemployment. The only thing that has changed is that things have continued to get worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907204">Tonight and tomorrow, as we look at the new job numbers, we are going to hear Liberals talk about how they are going to tinker with subsidy programs. We heard it already tonight from the <Affiliation DbId="319398" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation>. She talked about the Liberal promise of 6,000 new summer job positions. This is in a context where approaching 20% of returning students did not have a job this summer. We have a population of over two million post-secondary students, and 20% were struggling to find a job this summer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907205">The government said it was going to subsidize 6,000 more eight-week positions. The average tenure for the summer jobs program is eight weeks, which, by the way, makes no sense. Employers are generally looking for summer jobs where they can employ people throughout the summer but what the government does is it shortens the tenure of those jobs for political reasons. It wants to show how many jobs it created. It uses the same amount of money to create jobs of shorter duration, when it would make much more sense to create jobs of longer duration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907206">Fundamentally, we are not going to solve the problems that are created by bad economic policy, bad immigration policy and misaligned training policy by subsidizing a few thousand more jobs for eight weeks. We are going to solve this problem by unleashing our economy, by fixing our immigration system and by addressing the gaps in training that have become so acutely problematic. We need wholesale policy change to address the Liberal job loss crisis that has been caused by Liberal policies over the last 10 years. The Liberals have broken their promises on change. They continue, after six months, to deliver more of the same. Over 100,000 jobs have been lost in the last month.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8907208">Mr. Speaker, there is no question that it is crucial for all Canadians to have a secure footing in the workforce, especially in this unusual period when our economy is under threat and when many people are feeling anxious about their job prospects. That is why our government is committed to preparing the workforce. We are ensuring that workers of all ages have access to training, retraining and upskilling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907209">We need more Canadians working in the skilled trades. That is why we invest nearly $1 billion annually in apprenticeship supports for the Red Seal program. House construction, automotive service technicians, power line technicians, millwrights, horticulturists and truck and transport mechanics are all key to Canada's road to a prosperous future, so we are actively encouraging young people to consider developing trade careers that will help them and help the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907210">Let me say that after travelling across Ontario and hearing from skilled trades organizations this summer, I heard a common message. It was about the imperative of having child care on job sites and to help people go through training. If the member opposite is that concerned about ensuring we have a vibrant workforce, I would urge him to urge his party to support us in the building blocks of a strong economy. One of those building blocks is child care for parents who are working and want to take on some of these jobs in the skilled trades. That comes from people working in the skilled trades and training in the skilled trades and from the employers who employ them.</ParaText>

Bill <Document DbId="13547622" Type="3">C-5</Document>, the One Canadian Economy Act, provided the leadership to strengthen Canada's autonomy, resilience and security through economic integration. Building a stronger, more connected, more competitive Canada will drive business growth and set us on a path to create jobs from coast to coast to coast. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907212">On top of that, the legislation removed federal barriers to labour mobility, which is vitally important for provinces and territories and the licences and certification processes that are right now barriers for labour to move across provinces. We have to work on bringing those barriers to worker mobility down. A worker authorized in one jurisdiction must quickly and easily be able to work in another. That would make it easier for skilled workers to do their jobs across Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8907213">As the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has said, it is time to “build big, build bold, build now”.

              <ParaText id="8907214">Mr. Speaker, I happen to agree with some of the things the parliamentary secretary said. The biggest problem is that the Liberals are not doing them. It was our party that proposed significant increases in investments in the skilled trades through union-based training. The government has consistently failed on that over the last 10 years.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8907216">We are not going to subsidize our way out of this problem. What we need to do is address wealth-creation problems. What we heard at the human resources committee is that Liberal policies are blocking our energy sector and making investment in Canada so much more difficult. There is red tape, taxes and the failures on immigration policy. These things are holding our economy back.
