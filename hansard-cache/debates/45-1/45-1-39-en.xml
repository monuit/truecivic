              <ParaText id="8921355">In advance of the House's consideration of Private Members' Business, the Chair wishes to make a short statement concerning private members' bills and the royal recommendation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921356">Members will be aware that constitutional and procedural constraints govern certain financial matters in proposed legislation. Any bill proposing to spend public funds for a new and distinct purpose must be accompanied by a royal recommendation, which may only be transmitted to the House by a minister of the Crown.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921357">Any private member's bill that requires a royal recommendation must receive it prior to the putting of the question at third reading. Otherwise, the Speaker will not put the question, and the bill would then be dropped from the Order Paper.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8921358"> The Chair has examined the items in the order of precedence. I wish to inform the House that, on initial review, one bill appears to touch upon the Crown's financial prerogative: Bill <Document DbId="13586188" Type="4">C‑222</Document>, an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Canada Labour Code with regard to the death of a child, standing in the name of the member for <Affiliation DbId="317986" Type="2">Burnaby North—Seymour</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921359">I encourage members who would like to make arguments regarding whether this or any other bill in the order of precedence requires a royal recommendation to do so at an early opportunity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921360">Furthermore, the Chair would like to remind members of the rules governing debate on private members' business items. For motions and bills at the second reading stage, the debate proceeds as follows.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921361">The member moving the motion may speak for up to 15 minutes to start debate, followed by five minutes for questions and comments.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8921362">Any other member may speak to the motion for up to 10 minutes, with no period for questions and comments. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921363">Finally, just before the Chair puts the question to the House, the member moving the motion also has a five-minute right of reply to conclude the debate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921364">If members have any questions about Private Members' Business, they can consult the table officers or contact the Private Members' Business Office.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921365">I thank members for their attention.</ParaText>

            </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8921366"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="13584104" Type="4">C-225, An Act to amend the Criminal Code</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee. </ParaText>
              <ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="1">Bill C-225. Second reading</ProceduralText>
              <ParaText id="8921367"> He said: Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise on behalf of the people of Kamloops—Thompson—Nicola, but today it is a particular pleasure, a distinct pleasure, because today I believe I rise on behalf of all Canadians to report on an epidemic, something that touches all Canadians, which is intimate partner violence. This is a non-partisan issue. In drafting this bill, I deliberately made it as non-partisan as possible. I know sometimes things get quite partisan in the House, but this bill, in my view, and I say this with the greatest of sincerity, is a non-partisan bill to address the epidemic of intimate partner violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921368">I have spoken with a number of stakeholders, a number of people who have experienced intimate partner violence. I received those notes, and to anybody who is watching or listening today, please know that we hear their heartfelt words. When a victim pours out their heart to us in a note, saying that they were a victim of intimate partner violence and feel heard in a bill, it is my view that we should heed these words and pass that bill expeditiously.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921369">I know watching online today is the family of Bailey McCourt. For those who are unaware, Bailey was a young woman, a mother and a survivor of intimate partner violence. This summer, her former partner was convicted of abusing her, and within hours, he left the courtroom and murdered her. That allegation is before the court. Along with her was one of her friends, a relatively new friend, who survived.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921370">Bailey's family reached out to me a couple of weeks ago, and they asked that this law be known as Bailey's law. As politicians, we will sometimes attach a name to a law. I did not feel it was my place to do that, but when a victim's family reaches out and asks that this be done, it is not something we should easily ignore. I know Bailey's aunt Debbie is watching today, being the spokesperson for the McCourt family. I also had the opportunity to meet with Bailey's father Shane and stepmom Trish this past week during the break week. I hope I'm not paraphrasing inappropriately, but they provided unequivocal support for this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921371">People are watching. Canadians, victims and women's organizations are watching. I have received countless emails, correspondence and feedback from women's organizations. Why is that? It is because this bill would create the distinct offence of assault on an intimate partner. Right now, in the Criminal Code, assault does not distinguish between who someone assaults. The only distinguishment is if someone assaults a peace officer. We distinguish between assaulting a peace officer and assaulting someone in the general public, but we do not distinguish between punching somebody out at the bar and punching out an intimate partner, two very different things. One is a relationship predicated on trust, intimacy and sometimes dependence, as in financial dependence or the commingling of assets. The other happens randomly. When it comes to intimate partners, they are the most likely to experience a homicide, yet we in this House have stood idle, despite time after time this being brought up in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921372">The second thing this bill would do is create a charge of first-degree murder when somebody kills their intimate partner. Right now, first-degree murder is colloquially called “premeditated” in the United States and “planned and deliberate” in Canada. The other aspect of first-degree murder is that someone can be found guilty of first-degree murder when they commit a predicate offence, as in they kidnap somebody. The third is the killing of a peace officer. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921373">This bill would make a fourth category, which is the killing of an intimate partner. We have to deter and denounce this conduct, and more concretely, this House has to speak out about the killing of intimate partners, with a loud voice. This bill would do that.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8921374">Third, this bill would create a risk assessment. Right now, generally, the only mechanism to bring somebody before the court who is accused of intimate partner violence is when they breach their conditions. An accused person may be escalating to the point where they are a risk to their intimate partner without having breached their conditions. This bill would allow a judge to compel a person to go to court for an up to seven-day risk assessment so we can intercede before there is another victim. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921375">Doing this for seven days, I understand, is a deprivation of liberty, but in the grand scheme of things, based on the number of victims we are seeing, we have to intervene. This bill would permit a court to independently say, at the request of a victim or the prosecutor or through the court's own volition, that it is concerned about the safety of a victim and will make a determination on whether a victim will be safe pending trial, even if the person was granted bail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921376">Fourth, this bill would update the law of detention. Most people do not know much about section 490 of the Criminal Code, which was written probably 30 or 40 years ago, when people went to trial within three to six months. Right now, a police officer has to go to court every three months to renew the detention of something seized until charges are approved. I have been told this is the biggest time-waster that police experience in British Columbia. If somebody's computer is seized with child sexual abuse and exploitation material and the review takes 15 months, an officer will have gone to court four times, served the application four times and written four affidavits. In rural policing, they might be travelling two hours to deliver them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921377">These are common-sense and non-partisan issues. I have a rhetorical question. I am not sure who is going to be speaking on behalf of the Liberals or the Bloc, but I invite them to say at the outset whether they be supporting this bill. In fact, they can go one step further today and can allow debate to collapse. What that means is that we would vote on this bill forthwith.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921378">I do not know why we would prolong the current law of intimate partner violence, or the lack thereof, for another day. Why would we let the status quo exist for another day? This House can resoundingly denounce the current state, where women far too often see intimate partner violence, period. There are men who experience intimate partner violence, although it is disproportionately women. This House can denounce it right here, right now. If we allow debate to collapse, we can get this bill to committee forthwith.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921379">To whoever stands up for the Liberals, I invite them to take the first five seconds of their question to say whether they will allow debate to collapse and whether they will be supporting this bill. As I said, Bailey McCourt's family is watching; Canadians are watching.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921380">When it comes to intimate partner violence, in 2023, there were 123,319 victims aged 12 years and older, and firearms were present in over 1,000 cases. The year 2014 marked the lowest rates of IPV since comparable data became available. I wonder what happened in 2015. I am trying to remember. Since then, from 2014 to 2022, police-reported IPV rates increased 19% for women and girls and 21% for men and boys. In that period, intimate partner sexual assault increased 163%.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8921381">I introduced a bill previously, Bill <Document DbId="11946621" Type="4">C-299</Document>, that would have raised the sexual assault maximum to life imprisonment. I was actually heckled by two members of the Liberal Party when I did that. How do we stand in the way of this? How do we stand in the way of the bill when we have an increase of 163% of sexual assault against intimate partners? They are the people who are most likely to die at the hands of their partner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921382">Intimate partner physical assault has increased 14%. I may sound like a broken record. It feels as though we could hear a pin drop in this place. Why are we waiting? Will the Liberals allow debate to collapse? If the Liberals are not prepared to do that, are they prepared to support the bill? Are they prepared to address this on a consent motion so that we can make the bill law as quickly as possible?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921383">Most of my adult life has been spent in the justice system. I cannot tell members how many victims I have dealt with on this issue. There are people who live very good lives otherwise; everything appears perfectly normal, yet behind closed doors, these people are repeatedly victimized. This offence spans every socio-economic group. It does not matter whether someone is low income, working class or rich. They are at risk for intimate partner violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921384">Fifty-five per cent of women who experience physical or sexual intimate partner violence feared a partner at some point. Being afraid of a partner can indicate intimate partner violence that is more coercive, more severe and more likely to reflect a pattern of abusive behaviours.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921385"> In my home province of British Columbia, the Union of BC Municipalities, also known as UBCM, had its convention in Victoria from September 22 to 26. The Union of BC Municipalities endorsed a motion for B.C. to declare gender-based violence, intimate partner violence and human trafficking an epidemic in the province and to update its action plan to combat human trafficking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921386">In this House, we are expected to hear from the people on the ground. We are expected to reflect that in the laws we pass. Often, in the laws we pass, there are poison pills that are put in, wedge issues and such things. There is no wedge here. There is simply a desire on my part and a desire from the people on this side of the House, and I can speak only for my colleagues, to get the bill passed as soon as possible. The Union of BC Municipalities is not specifically asking for this, but it is asking for action when it passes a resolution of this sort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921387"> I have spoken with Angela MacDougall from Battered Women's Support Services. People from that organization attended the UBCM conference in Victoria to push for these actions: having a municipal, gender-based violence task force to stabilize frontline services; standardizing risk assessment, and this bill actually has a risk assessment built into it, a mechanism by which the court can bring somebody before it; launching a province-wide prevention campaign; and appointing a gender-based violence lead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921388">I am grateful to our deputy leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="317856" Type="2">Thornhill</Affiliation>, for seconding this important bill and speaking to this important bill. I reiterate that this bill should be passed. It should be passed quickly. It should go to committee as quickly as possible. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921389">Victims are watching. Let us get Bailey's law passed. Will the Liberals do that? Will they agree to let debate collapse so that this can get to a vote and get to committee? Those are my questions because I know we have to address this and address it now.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8921426">Madam Speaker, I rise today in response to Bill <Document DbId="13584104" Type="4">C-225</Document>, a private member's bill introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="317911" Type="2">Kamloops—Thompson—Nicola</Affiliation>, to speak about intimate partner violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921427">I want to acknowledge the sponsor of the bill for bringing it forward and to note that addressing intimate partner violence is a priority for this government and a key commitment in our platform.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8921428">Bill <Document DbId="13584104" Type="4">C-225</Document> proposes three sets of reforms to address intimate partner violence. First, it will create new offences and sanctions specific to domestic violence. Second, it will amend the Criminal Code with regard to the detention of seized property. Third, it will make changes to the bail process for cases involving intimate partner violence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921429">Although these proposals may seem well intentioned, they require thoughtful, evidence-based measures to truly protect victims, rather than ill-conceived changes that could negatively affect them.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8921430">Over the past several years, this government has taken bold and decisive action to protect victims of IPV and hold offenders accountable. In 2019, through Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, we strengthened the Criminal Code by defining “intimate partner” for all purposes, including ex-spouses; creating a reverse onus at bail for accused with prior IPV convictions; requiring courts to consider those prior convictions; and clarifying that strangulation is an elevated form of assault.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921431">Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> also imposed higher maximum penalties for repeat offenders, emphasized denunciation and deterrence, and ensured consistent sentencing for abuse against spouses, former spouses, dating partners and family members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921432">It is therefore very concerning that the Conservatives have said in this House, time and time again, that they want to repeal this critical piece of legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921433">A former bill, Bill <Document DbId="11536206" Type="4">C-233</Document>, was introduced in 2023 by my friend and colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="317896" Type="2">Dorval—Lachine—LaSalle</Affiliation>. It brought in critical tools, such as the electronic monitoring of IPV offenders, ensuring that courts could impose conditions to actively prevent repeat IPV.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921434">Bill <Document DbId="11536206" Type="4">C-233</Document> also provided an opportunity for judges to further their education on coercive control and IPV, thus ensuring that the judiciary understands the complexities that so many survivors experience.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8921435">Similarly, the government's Bill <Document DbId="12426046" Type="3">C-48</Document> broadened the reverse onus for bail to target repeat IPV offenders, in direct response to victims' concerns that they were at ongoing risk when repeat offenders were released on bail.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8921436">Our government takes this issue seriously. The safety of women and girls is a top priority. Studies and inquiries, from those of Statistics Canada to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, show that IPV and gender-based violence remain pervasive. Coroner's inquest commissions, including the Renfrew county inquest and the Mass Casualty Commission, have recommended having new offences on coercive control, modernizing criminal harassment and addressing femicide. These recommendations are all being carefully considered for comprehensive reforms.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8921437">As a woman and a mother of two daughters, I am proud to say that I understand the personal responsibility that we have to protect women and girls in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921438">I would remind the House that our women's caucus is the largest in Canada's history. Each of the women in this caucus works tirelessly, every day, to advance laws that protect women and girls.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8921439">In stark contrast, the Conservatives have consistently voted against measures that protect women. They gutted essential women's and gender-equality programs, leaving vulnerable women at risk. They opposed the national action plan to end gender-based violence, a plan that is now delivering $539.3 million in crucial funding to women's organizations across the country, including $1.2 million in the riding of the sponsor of the bill, the riding of the member for <Affiliation DbId="317911" Type="2">Kamloops—Thompson—Nicola</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921440">I know that the member for <Affiliation DbId="317911" Type="2">Kamloops—Thompson—Nicola</Affiliation> cares deeply about his community, and I respect him for that. However, when it comes to voting for the safety of women in his riding, he has consistently voted against these measures, following the instructions of his <Affiliation DbId="322132" Type="9">leader</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921441">I also want to highlight the voices of survivors and of frontline organizations. Last month I met with women's shelters across Quebec. I was deeply moved. These organizations told me that the rhetoric around IPV must be less toxic, and they have asked us to work together in the House, as Parliament, to get it right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921442">As a woman, I am particularly concerned about Bill <Document DbId="13584104" Type="4">C-225</Document>'s proposal to automatically classify all IPV-related killings as first-degree murder. Let me explain. The proposal means that a charge of first-degree murder, under Bill C-225, would also apply to women who, as victims, have endured IPV abuse, including possible coercive control, and who in turn have killed their abuser.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921443">While Conservatives may argue that self-defence would still be available for these victims, they know full well that in IPV cases where women have not reported prior abuse to police, self-defence becomes complex. Bill <Document DbId="13584104" Type="4">C-225</Document> would penalize abused women who kill their aggressors, with 25 years of jail. This approach risks penalizing victims instead of focusing on the culpability of abusers, overriding decades of jurisprudence that recognizes the cumulative effects of abuse. That is why we need laws that make practical sense, not measures that merely sound tough in name. This is serious. Our laws must protect victims, not punish them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921444">The government's approach is deliberate and evidence-driven. We recognize that IPV is complex and cannot be solved with isolated legal tweaks. Our criminal law must reflect the full spectrum of IPV, including coercive control, assault and strangulation. That is why our upcoming reforms, developed in collaboration with provinces, territories, survivors, families of victims, legal experts and frontline organizations, are carefully targeted to protect survivors and to hold offenders accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921445">I offer my hand to my colleagues across the aisle and hope they will support our upcoming legislation that would, in the House, address these issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921446">To all women, I say that the government has their back. We prioritize their safety. We listen to survivors. We work hand in hand with law enforcement. We invest in programs and legislation that prevent and respond to intimate partner violence, and the <Affiliation DbId="318625" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> is actively working with survivors, families and law enforcement to crack down on IPV offenders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921447">The government will continue to strengthen protection. We will enforce accountability, and we will modernize our criminal laws, because every woman and girl in Canada deserves to live free from fear. We will get this right.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8921448">Madam Speaker, I would like to begin my remarks by reiterating my solidarity and compassion for all victims of violence, particularly victims of intimate partner violence. This morning, I am especially thinking of the family and loved ones of Gabie Renaud, whose partner is accused of murdering her. There was a demonstration in her honour yesterday, and hundreds of people came out to express their support for Gabie Renaud's family and loved ones.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921449">This is the kind of tragedy that should never happen. It is the kind of tragedy that we, as legislators, must prevent if we can. I am very pleased that my colleague is bringing this issue to the House and that we can discuss it in committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921450">I hope for calm discussions. Obviously, it is very difficult to stay calm when faced with situations like this one. People tend to get carried away and to want revenge. There is no other word for this crime: It is revolting. However, I think we need to take a step back. We need to look at the situation with wisdom and perspective in order to make decisions that will be applicable, first of all, and, second, that will promote societal harmony now, in 2025.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921451">As I was saying, yesterday, I was in the mood to revolt, not only against these situations, but also against myself and this entire legislative body, because so far, it has not demonstrated that enough resources are being put in place to prevent such tragedies from happening. However, I think that we need to proceed in a balanced way. Unlike some people, I continue to believe that the presumption of innocence is essential in our society. I continue to believe that offender rehabilitation is a valuable goal that we must strive for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921452"> However, I also continue to believe that we owe it to each and every person in this country to keep our streets and our communities safe. I also continue to believe that we can and must stand in solidarity with individuals who may be victims of controlling and coercive behaviour, violence or any other similar behaviour. We must stand in solidarity with them and help them every day. Every one of us must look at our families, our friends and the people around us, identify potentially problematic situations and intervene as best we can.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921453">This brings me back to our work as legislators. Striking this balance between the presumption of innocence, rehabilitation and keeping our streets safe will not be easy. However, that is the challenge before us. It is a challenge that I accept, and I look forward to hearing from people and experts in committee. They will come and help us identify the major principles that need to be addressed and how to implement them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921454">We have been through this process before. The Assistant Deputy Speaker was there. No doubt she remembers that we addressed this subject several times in previous Parliaments. In the last Parliament, a bill was introduced by our colleague, whose riding I forget, but it is on Vancouver Island. He introduced a bill that touched on this aspect of coercive control, which we all agreed on. All of us welcomed it with open arms. It went to the Senate, but one thing led to another, and Parliament was prorogued. Unfortunately, the bill died on the Order Paper.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921455">Now we need to take a look at this problem again. What our Conservative colleague is proposing today is not exactly the same as what was proposed back then, but it is still worthwhile for us to come together to reflect on this problem and find solutions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8921456">A typical knee-jerk reaction is to present simple solutions. If everyone is put in prison, there will be no more crime. Obviously, I know that no one is suggesting that. However, there is this mentality that individuals should be put in prison as soon as there is a risk. The opposite mentality is that everyone is presumed innocent, regardless of the danger to public safety. I think we need to find a middle ground, a balance between those extremes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921457">I also think that when someone is charged with a violent crime for the third, fifth or 10th time, it should force the realization that rehabilitation programs have not worked for that individual. Different measures need to be taken than those that would be used for their first offence or first charge. Of course, we always need to be careful not to go overboard. I do not want innocent people to be detained. That should happen as little as possible. There are some such cases, there always have been, and there probably always will be, because to err is human. Judicial error is also human. However, we still need to be cautious in our approach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921458">We should take a prudent approach and find a middle ground between throwing everyone in jail and letting everyone out of jail. There are options available in 2025 that did not exist 20 or 40 years ago, like electronic bracelets. This creates some issues because it infringes on individual freedoms, yet imprisonment also infringes on individual freedoms. Should we use electronic bracelets more often? Maybe the answer is yes, or maybe it is no. Maybe we should do that in some circumstances but not others. That is the kind of question I would like to ask experts when this matter comes before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921459">I think a little more imagination is needed in order to come up with solutions and to eliminate the problem. I would very much like to hear some actual statistics. We hear all sorts of things. As parliamentarians, we hear from our constituents. That is fine, and actually it is quite a good thing. We are accountable to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921460">For example, some people are saying that spousal homicides have skyrocketed over the past five years. That may be the case. However, other people are saying that the number has actually gone down. Some folks are saying that we need to put more people in prison, while others say that prisons are already too full of people awaiting trial. According to some, there are more people in our prisons who have not yet been tried than there are convicted criminals. That makes no sense. How do we find the right balance? I do not know where the right balance is. What I do know is that I have to try to find it. That is my job and the job of everyone here. To do that, as I said, we will need to hear from experts who will help us understand these issues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921461">The case of Gabie Renaud strikes a particular chord with me. I am committed to doing everything I can to make sure that nothing like this happens again. I am extending an invitation to my government colleagues. Yes, we have a job as legislators, but the government also has a job. It needs to free up the funding required to fight crime. It is all well and good to talk about rehabilitation. When I say that I believe in rehabilitation, I mean that it is part of my values. I believe that this is what we should be striving for. Are we able to rehabilitate people today, though? Perhaps not as much as we would like. It takes money and organizations. Programs need to be set up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921462">Are we able to do that? If so, let us go ahead and do it. If not, let us acknowledge that and ensure that we do whatever it takes to find a way to do it. Rehabilitation falls mainly to Quebec and the provinces. Let us free up the funding necessary so that the people and governments that need to work on this are able to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921463">With regard to the presumption of innocence, there is a balance between the rights and freedoms provided for in all of our charters and laws. This is important, but we also need to work on it. The Supreme Court has set maximum time limits for holding trials. However, the provinces and Quebec do not have enough money to build courthouses, appoint judges, and hire court clerks and bailiffs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921464">Grand principles are all well and good, but they must be reflected in concrete measures. I therefore call on our government to free up the necessary funds and to work with Quebec and the provinces so that we can uphold the presumption of innocence and keep our streets safe.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8921466">We all come to this place to leave our mark and make a difference. I think this piece of legislation is one of the ways there could be a measurable outcome. This bill would certainly do all of that. I strongly support it, as all members in the House should, because it would take meaningful and concrete action to protect people from the growing scourge of intimate partner violence, which has even been called an epidemic in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921467">It seems like everybody has stories of their own experiences with intimate partner violence. We hear about it from a close friend or family member. We read about it online or on social media. In some cases, we have heard in the House that members have experienced it themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921468">I will never forget something that happened in my first month of being a member of Parliament, when I was so ill-equipped for this job, not knowing what was ahead. A woman sat across from me, veiled behind a brave smile. Her long sleeves were covering bruising, and her face was masked with heavy makeup in some places. She claimed, with a quiet confidence, that when she told me she had tripped, she knew I would understand what she was saying without my ever asking for any more details. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921469">The story she eventually told made me realize that, in that moment, behind closed doors, every single word in her old life had been a weapon, and every single apology had been a trap. It all started with control, not fists. Then came the fear. Then came the silence, and for her, then came the isolation. The story she told me ended long after it first began. She ended up packing a small bag. It took all the courage she had. Her first step out of her door was her first step to freedom.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921470">These are the stories of survivors, the ones we have to believe, the ones who have to be protected. We blur out the details of these stories not for effect, but to protect those who are still silently struggling, long after they have walked out the door. I just want to say to those who may be watching today, that if this is them, they should please talk to a police office, please talk to somebody they trust.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921471">This does not always look like that textbook experience that happened to me in my first month on the job. Keira Kagan’s story was different. It was a story from right within my own community, a story that happened among my own peer group. Keira was a bright, beautiful four-year-old girl. She had a smile that would light up a room and a sense of curiosity that made everyone around her know that someday she would go places, but tragically, she never got there. She will never graduate from school, start a career, start a family or have kids of her own.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921472">Keira was killed five years ago by her father in a horrific act of domestic violence. Her life was stolen from her before it had hardly begun. The warning signs were all there. At least 22 different risk factors were identified in a report released after Keira’s death. Her father was in a custody battle with her mother, Jen. He had a history of mental illness and domestic violence against Keira’s mother and against other partners. He displayed misogynistic attitudes, threatened others and even committed acts of violence against pets. However, despite all of that, despite all the red flags, the warning signs and the cries for help, Keira was still released into her father’s custody in what can only be described as a colossal failure of the system. She was killed just a few days later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921473">In the last Parliament, the House unanimously passed a bill called Keira’s law, which expanded training for judges to include domestic violence and coercive control. The bill introduced by my hon. friend picks up where that bill left off by modernizing the detention of seized evidence, forcing those convicted of domestic violence to be released only by a judge and treating the murder of an intimate partner as first-degree murder. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8921474">Creating specific offences matters, such as the specific offences of the assault of an intimate partner and criminal harassment of an intimate partner, and these could have helped in the tragic story of Keira. The legislation would allow the courts to detain the accused of intimate partner violence at any time for a risk assessment, the kind of assessment that would be done before, not after, things go wrong. That kind of assessment could have saved Keira's life. We cannot and should not be complacent in fighting this scourge in the House.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921475">In just 10 years, intimate partner physical assault has increased by 14%, harassment is up 38% and intimate partner sexual assault is up a whopping 163%. We could talk all day about the reasons this is happening, but nobody can deny that the lack of accountability in our justice system is a major reason intimate partner violence and crimes of all types are running rampant and are out of control in this country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921476">Let us take another case of somebody we have talked about in the House. Her name was Bailey McCourt. Bailey's partner, James Plover, was convicted of three counts of uttering threats and one count of assault by strangling in the case of intimate partner violence. He was released on bail, and he killed Bailey that very same day. She died in a parking lot, after being beaten with a hammer. If our bail laws had been fixed, James Plover would not have been allowed out on bail and Bailey would be alive today, to be the mother to her children. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921477">Her family is watching right now. I spoke to her aunt in the lobby just a few minutes ago, and she is absolutely disgusted that this bill will not be supported by the other side. She is disgusted at the comments coming from the other side. The same could be said for the over 120,000 victims of intimate partner violence in 2023 alone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921478">Every case of this is not just a statistic that we talk about in Parliament as a number. It is not an excuse for the government to tell Canadians, when they ask serious questions about the government doing something on bail, that it is coming tomorrow, next week, next month or someday. Even one case of intimate partner violence should be enough to make this place act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921479">Every preventable act should be a wake-up call to get people in the chairs in this place to do something about it. Instead, the changes Conservatives propose in this place on the bail system or on sentencing requirements to the Criminal Code are voted down time and time again, only to again be told that it is coming tomorrow. However, for Bailey, Keira and countless others, tomorrow never comes. Every day that we delay is another day for serial abusers to harass their victims without consequences, for more men and women to suffer physical and emotional trauma and for innocent lives to be put in danger. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921480">Taking action someday, frankly, just is not enough. Someday will not put the bad guys in jail. The message now to anyone watching and everyone on the other side is this: They should act now before more preventable tragedies happen, because the only thing worse than a case of intimate partner violence is a case that we had the ability to stop.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921481"> This piece of legislation would save lives. It would prevent escalation of intimate partner violence. It would stop the warning signs when they first occur, and it would keep those with a track record of violence behind bars. Police unions have told us we need this. Advocacy groups, frontline workers, women and victim survivors have all told us they need this. They all told us to strengthen the penalties of intimate partner violence, to automatically make murder of an intimate partner first-degree murder, regardless of why or how it happened. They told us, most importantly, to put victims first, and that is exactly what my colleague's bill would do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921482">I can only hope that everybody in this place reconsiders, stands up, does the right thing, remembers exactly why we came here and supports this piece of legislation.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8921483">Madam Speaker, let me start off by recognizing that I do not believe that there is a member of Parliament in the House who does not appreciate our need, as parliamentarians, to look at what happens to victims of intimate partner violence. It is a very serious issue. I believe that every member of Parliament, and it does not matter which political entity they are a part of, wants to do what they can to minimize the intimate partner violence that takes place in our nation. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921484">To the families that have been affected over the years, as victims, families and friends of those victims, I would extend my personal condolences, thoughts and prayers. I can understand and appreciate the destruction it causes within a family unit. When I talk about the family unit, I am talking about extended families. It has a profoundly negative impact, and that is why I say, without any hesitation, that all members of the House of Commons, I would like to think, are very sensitive to this very important public issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921485">Thinking of the victims, I would like to turn it around a little here and emphasize that there are many instances of intimate partner violence that go unreported. Unfortunately, and sadly, we have individuals in society who are constantly abused, whether physically or mentally, for years, as has been pointed out. I know that the person proposing the legislation is aware of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921486">We can imagine, if we will, being a young woman who has been subjected to all sorts of mental and physical abuse in a relationship but who, out of fear, does not necessarily report it. There are reasons why that happens. If the legislation were to pass, that victim I just described could become a victim of the legislation. Ultimately, for the individual who I have described, if there is something that takes place that triggers the death of her or his partner, the legislation would automatically say that it should be first-degree murder. This is the impact that this would also have. We know for a fact that there are endless victims of domestic violence in our communities who do not report.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921487">I know this first-hand. I have dealt with victims who are coming to talk to me, to share their experiences. We try, as much as possible, to encourage, to look for support groups, such as women's shelters, and to look at ways in which society and our system could support that victim in receiving some sort of justice. Often, it is not just the one victim. A lot of those victims of domestic abuse also have young children. They too, in essence, become victims.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921488">That is why I say that, at the end of the day, I would like to think that there is not a member of the House of Commons who is not sympathetic and who does not want to see actions taken in domestic abuse. The member brought forward the legislation and said that there are two things that come to mind. One is to pass the legislation and to pass it immediately. I have often articulated the importance of passing government legislation. This legislation is actually programmed.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8921489">Could members imagine if I were to put on limits, saying that for every government bill, there would be only two hours of debate at second reading and then it would go to committee? This particular individual says this legislation should be going to committee, virtually without debate. It is just like how the Conservatives attempted to bring through an opposition day motion on the issue. I wish we could get that sort of sympathy toward government legislation dealing with the victims of crime, such as the bail legislation that will be coming out very soon, but I suspect we will not see it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921490">The member was critical of me many months ago because of some so-called reaction I had when he brought in legislation. That was absolutely bogus.

This government has taken apolitical action, and we have seen nothing but political reaction coming from the Conservatives, day in and day out. In fact, in the example I was providing, the member used a false pretense on social media in order to generate negative feelings toward the legislation or toward me personally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921504">At the end of the day, we recognize that the issue is important. That is why we have taken many steps, whether they are legislative initiatives or budgetary measures, to support women. The parliamentary secretary for the department made it very clear that we, as a government, have invested tens of millions of dollars in fighting domestic violence and supporting women in our communities, yet time and time again, we get Conservative after Conservative standing up and voting against our initiatives. That is the reality. When a Conservative member stands up and says, “I have a bill”, I will emphasize time and time again how important it is that we, as parliamentarians, do whatever we can to support the victims of intimate partner violence. I will stand up all the time and advocate for doing what we can.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8921529">The components related to the second theme include, first, amending the accelerated scheduling pathway to allow precursor chemicals that can be used to produce illicit drugs to be rapidly controlled by the Minister of Health. This would allow law and border enforcement agencies to take swift action to prevent the illegal importation and use of precursor chemicals, and it would ensure strict federal oversight over any legitimate use of these chemicals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921530"> Second, the proposed measures would strengthen Canada's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regime, including through stronger anti-money laundering penalties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921531">Third, the measures contained in the bill would enhance supervisory collaboration and support high standards of regulatory compliance by adding the director of the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, or FINTRAC, to the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee. FINTRAC would also be enabled to exchange supervisory information on federally regulated financial institutions with FISC.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921532"> I am happy to say that these proposed measures would complement ongoing efforts to secure our border from coast to coast to coast, including the $1.3-billion investment made in December last year to increase resources dedicated to border security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921533">Meanwhile, Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> will continue, with further study, to advance the elements that would facilitate law enforcement’s access to basic and subscriber information, introduce the supporting authorized access to information act, expand the inspection authority of Canada Post, introduce new restrictions on third party deposits and large cash transfers, and clarify public-to-private information-sharing provisions to help better detect and deter money laundering. We heard the concern that it is important that we get this right.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921534">As a result of our strong partnership with the United States, last year, nearly $3.6 billion in trade and about 400,000 people crossed the Canada-U.S. border every single day. We want to make sure that this continues. Following both the former prime minister's and current <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s discussions with President Trump, Canada committed to a set of measures that would further strengthen security at the border and expand on our $1.3-billion border plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921535"> In support of the plan, in February, a new intelligence directive on organized crime and illegal fentanyl was signed, and it will be backed by a $200-million investment. This includes the creation of the joint operational intelligence cell, which builds on existing co-operation mechanisms between law enforcement partners and security agencies to better leverage information sharing to target transnational organized crime, money laundering and drug trafficking and improve border security.</ParaText>

Through our border plan, we are building our information and intelligence-sharing capacity among federal, provincial and territorial authorities as well as with the United States and other international partners, including our Five Eyes partners. Enhanced information sharing allows authorities to identify, monitor and collaborate with partners to intercept high-risk individuals and goods attempting to travel between countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921546">Meanwhile, as too many families know, illegal fentanyl has a devastating impact on both sides of our border. While less than 1% of illegal fentanyl seized in the United States is linked to Canada, we are working to ensure fewer drugs and their precursor chemicals cross our shared border. To increase our fentanyl-detection abilities, we have trained and are deploying border detector dog teams that specialize in fentanyl detection.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921547">With respect to immigration, under the border plan, we have already strengthened our visa screening and integrity to keep those who seek to remain in Canada illegally, or to cross into the United States illegally, out of Canada. We have increased our ability to remove bad actors from Canada. As well, the CBSA removed over 18,000 inadmissible people in 2024-25, the highest in a decade and an increase from approximately 16,000 the year before. The border plan provides $55.5 million to support immigration and asylum processing and to increase CBSA’s capacity to reach 20,000 removals over the next two years, including this year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921548">With our current focus on the border and our plans to introduce further measures to strengthen the criminal justice system in the future, Canadians can be confident that Canada has a strong border and that we continue to build an even stronger one.

They spoke about the big, bad Conservatives' passing big, bad omnibus bills, and they said that the Liberals would never, ever pass omnibus bills, yet here we are: One of many omnibus bills comes to us in the form of Bill C-2, with a number of problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921590">Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, if memory serves, would enact or alter 15 pieces of legislation. It is about 120 pages long, if memory serves, and the Liberals told us to just pass it, just trust them. Given some of the rhetoric in the House today, it is somewhat comical that the Liberals would use this type of language: Just pass this, just trust them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921591">As members of His Majesty's loyal opposition, our job is to listen to Canadians and to closely scrutinize government legislation. In a 120-page bill, there are problems. I am going to highlight one of those problems, and I really hope that the member for <Affiliation DbId="317752" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> is listening closely to this one: the warrantless search.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921592">The member has spoken to the House ad nauseam, no fewer than five or six times, about the fact that Canada Post could not open up mail without a warrant. They have a number of lawyers on the Liberal side. We have a number of lawyers here. However, the legislation actually speaks really clearly, so I am going to read the legislation into the record just so that we are really clear on this, and then I will speak about what we have been through with a number of bureaucrats.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8921593"> Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, in part 4, proposes to replace subsection 41(1) of the act with the following:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921594">
                <Quote>

              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921595">The reasonable suspicion part relates to regulation, so if any regulation is suspected to be breached, Canada Post could open our mail.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921596"> If I am understanding it clearly, the intent of the legislation is to cover up a gap, in that mail cannot not be opened with a warrant. In other words, we want to make it so that anybody shipping something that is 499 grams or less could be subject to a warranted search, a search that is authorized by a judge.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921597"> I admire the member's zeal for sticking with this position, which is a position I thought was untenable, so let us go through that again. Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> states that the corporation may open any mail, so that includes letters, parcels or anything. I think we are all on solid ground and know what “any mail” means. It states that it “may” open it, so it would not be compulsory. The government would not have to open mail, but the legislation would be permissive; the government could open any mail if it had reasonable grounds to suspect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921598">The bill refers to the “Corporation”, which is very interesting. The corporation legally has personhood, but the corporation is made up of people. Those people, generally, are not going to be peace officers. In fact, I do not know whether Canada Post has any peace officers in its employ. The legislation would not even require a peace officer, so theoretically it could be somebody in the mail room who has no training. We hear all about RCMP training and things like that. Somebody with no training could open up mail; they may, not shall, do so if they have reasonable grounds to suspect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921599">The member for <Affiliation DbId="317752" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> has told us so many times that a warrant would be needed. I went to a briefing with top officials from the government, and they told me that based on the provisions, a warrant would not be needed. Imagine that. The words are so clear that a warrant would not be needed, so let us just go through it one more time for clarity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921600">Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> states:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8921603">Here is the real kicker: reasonable grounds. I have not practised law for about four years, but my recollection is that a search warrant is issued by a judge when there are reasonable grounds to believe, based on oath or affirmation, than an offence has been committed, that there is evidence of that offence and that the place to be searched will yield evidence of the offence. Those three characteristics are needed with reasonable grounds to believe.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921604">Let us go back to the plain language:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8921606">Wait a minute. That is not reasonable grounds to believe, as is needed for a warrant, yet the Liberals have repeatedly stood up in this place and said that Conservatives are full of conspiracy theories and that a warrant would be needed, when it says right in the bill that a warrant would not be needed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921607">The member for <Affiliation DbId="317752" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> is very active in questions and comments, and God forbid that any member of the House would misspeak, so I really look forward to his addressing the issue in questions and comments. In fact, perhaps a page can run the document over to him, because it says it right in it, and the member can tell us whether he still believes this, or acknowledges perhaps that Conservatives were correct on the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921608">This leads me to Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> generally. Bill C-2 was a mess. The government went very far. We can all acknowledge that border security is an issue, but the legislation went very far, and we heard about it from Canadians. The Liberals have said that we need the legislation and need it done, and they have asked how we dare stand in the way of border security and things like that. However, as Conservatives, we played our role as opposition, and we did so very clearly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921609">We took issue, and people will notice that the matters with which we took issue are not matters in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>. I take great pride in what we have done, because that is what an opposition does. An opposition scrutinizes, considers and opposes, when and where it is appropriate to oppose.</ParaText>

It is by no coincidence that occurred, because we as Conservatives consistently raised the plain language in Bill C-2, which I think I will quote again:</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8921612">Then it goes on to the regulations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921613">What other things are missing? Conservatives raised substantial questions about privacy concerns, parts 14 and 15, what is colloquially called lawful access. People have said I should know about the R v. Bykovets decision. I do know about the Bykovets decision very well. I think I was still practising law when it came out. That decision said there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in an IP address. As parliamentarians, we have to remedy the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921614">We have actually seen that when the Liberals want to remedy an untenable decision for the House, they have no problem doing it quickly. I will note that they have failed to do that on the issue of bail. There were three or four decisions on bail that they actually codified. That means they took the language from the decision and put it into legislation. They did not push back on it. Section 33.1, the defence of extreme intoxication, was struck out. There was legislation before the House within weeks of that happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921615">The Liberals did not want a law on the books. They did not want a lack of law that said that extreme intoxication is an excuse for a general intent offence, that is, when someone does not legally have the ability to commit the offence. I believe it goes to the <I>actus reus</I> defence, but it has been a while. In any event, the Liberals responded with legislation very quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921616">The Liberals did not really care so much about bail, but now they say they are tough on crime. This is after former ministers of justice Virani and Lametti stood just across the aisle in the House to tell us there is no problem with bail. The Liberals have no problem responding when it is consistent with their agenda.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921617">In Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, what the Liberals will not acknowledge is that it was robust opposition that led to elements that should be debated in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>'s forming Bill C-12, as well as other very questionable issues in Bill C-2's remaining in Bill C-2. It also begs this question: What is going to happen in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921618">Perhaps we can have another debate on Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, and the member for <Affiliation DbId="317752" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> can stand up and speak about warrantless searches of mail. The Liberals could also discuss cash transactions, how much money should be permitted, and whether we should actually be telling Canadians how much cash they can or cannot use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921619">I just want to pause to acknowledge somebody who has done tremendous work when it comes to democracy and participating in democracy. That person is named Dawson McKay. He is a Crown prosecutor in British Columbia. I admire his passion for the rule of law and what is right, and I want to thank him for his contributions to democracy. He is somebody with a deep conscience, a deep desire to do what is right. I thank him for his work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921620">I would also like to thank somebody else, another prosecutor, Alex Wheele. He works out of the Kamloops Crown counsel office in Kamloops—Thompson—Nicola. He is somebody I had the pleasure of meeting when he was in law school and was just thinking about becoming a prosecutor, and we spoke. I taught his now wife in the faculty of business back then. I am very proud to call Alex a friend. I am so grateful for his work in contributing to democracy. I am also proud of his work in contributing to public safety. I want to recognize that formally in the House of Commons.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8921621">We have spoken about the mail provisions, and we have spoken about Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> generally and how we got here. Now let us focus on Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, what is in it and what is not. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921622"> I know that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="317742" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman</Affiliation> will be giving a speech today. I am sure he will give it with his characteristic zeal and great detail, as he is so often known for in the House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921623">What is not in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>? There is no mandatory prison time for fentanyl traffickers. I believe we heard from the <Affiliation DbId="318708" Type="5">Secretary of State for Combatting Crime</Affiliation> that the Liberals are “tough on crime”. That was actually said in the House. Really? Apparently, now the Liberals are going to come out with legislation. We have not even seen the legislation yet, but we are being told that we should support it. I would think the House would support a bill on intimate-partner violence, but that remains to be seen. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921624"> I am told the legislation has good stuff in it and speaks about sex offences and people who committee sex offences no longer getting house arrest. I have probably raised this issue 15 times in the House, and the Liberals have openly mocked our views when it comes to justice. I actually raised this issue with the minister of justice at one time, and I heard, “Do not worry. When somebody commits a serious crime, they will get serious time.” What happened to the mentality of trusting judges? The Liberals told us we should trust judges; they are appointed. Now they say, “Wait a minute. There is no more house arrest for sex offences.” They do not trust judges any more; they are tough on crime. It is something they mocked us for. I am worried that I am going to wake up with a stiff neck tomorrow based on the whiplash I am getting from the government, which is now tough on crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921625">What else do we not have in the bill? There is no mandatory prison time for gangsters who use guns to commit crimes. A person can get house arrest for a drive-by shooting. What is worse is that this was not the court's doing; it was the Liberals' doing. For Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document>, Mr. Lametti, then a minister, said he did not think that somebody had to go to jail for popping off a couple of shots into a bar after having a couple of pops. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921626">Intending to discharge a gun, if done in a car, is called a drive-by shooting. If it is done otherwise, it is a called a shooting with intent. There used to be a four-year mandatory minimum, which was constitutionally upheld in a case called Oud, I might add, for the Liberals who say that everything was always struck down under the Conservatives. However, it went from a four-year sentence to potentially house arrest. Now the Liberals are tough on crime, but not tough enough to put this into an omnibus bill to keep us all safe. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921627">The Liberals have created what I would call a porous border, and that porous border is allowing firearms to get in like never before. What should we be doing? People will say to me that denunciation and deterrence do not work. They have been our sentencing principles in the Criminal Code from time immemorial, but they will say they do not work. I am starting to have serious questions about the fact that people can repeatedly commit crimes and believe they are untouchable. I saw this happen on so many occasions in my employment before I was blessed to be present in the House. When we let somebody operate with impunity when it comes to the criminal law, we will invariably have an outcome that they repeat the behaviour, because they have learned that there will be no consequences from it. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is silent on that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921628"> I hope the Liberals will give credit where credit is due as to how Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> came here. We will scrutinize this legislation and we will go from there. </ParaText>

If somebody commits an offence, despite the fact that border officers with the CBSA are police officers, which grants them specific powers under the Criminal Code, their mandate does not permit them to go beyond a port of entry. Let us say somebody had a kilogram of cocaine and it was dropped outside a port of entry. Even if it was in sight, the CBSA could not get it. This has been stated to the government time after time. If it wants to make meaningful changes, that is something we should be debating in this House. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8921652">We should not shy away from asking the hard questions in this place. Sometimes they will be contentious. Sometimes the answers will be very easy and sometimes they will be difficult. I know somebody had an idea in mind when they restricted the CBSA's border mandate to not go beyond the port of entry, but we should not shy away from discussing these things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921653">In answer to my colleague's question, I would be happy to include this in a study. I think it is something we should be debating. We should not shy away from it. There are sometimes very tough questions. They are often difficult questions to ask because we have to consider the RCMP, which currently has the mandate. How far are they from the borders? There are going to be borders where they might have a 15- or 20-minute response time. That is unacceptable in my view. I think the time has come for us to have a robust discussion on that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921654">My colleague pointed out that CBSA members are armed. That was done under the Harper government.

              <ParaText id="8921656">I would like to congratulate the newly acclaimed mayors in my riding. We recently had an election in Quebec for cities and municipalities.

              <ParaText id="8921657">Today, we are discussing Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C‑12</Document>. With the exception of three parts, it is almost identical to Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C‑2</Document>, previously presented by the government with considerable fanfare. Viewers at home will recall that the bill's number, Bill C‑2, reflects the fact that the government was intent on bringing this bill forward urgently at the start of this Parliament. That is why today, in mid-October, we are dealing with another bill that has the same objectives, but is now known as Bill C‑12.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921658">What does that mean? It means that this bill was initially intended to appease the President of the United States after he set a very high bar for Canada in terms of border security requirements. The <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised to respond forcefully to the problem and to introduce a very strong bill to secure the borders, known as Bill C‑2 at that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921659">The Bloc Québécois has carefully examined Bill C‑12 and we want the government to know that we support sending it to committee for study.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921660">However, what worries me is that I heard the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> say that Bill C‑2 has only been postponed, and I have read that too. In other words, in order to be able to pass the other parts of Bill C‑2 through Bill C‑12, he removed the contentious parts that were preventing it from being passed unanimously, namely all the parts that violated privacy or anything that did not comply with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921661"> In its report, the Library of Parliament provided a whole list of Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms violations, including the section that protects the right to life, liberty and security of any person in Canada, and section 8, which provides protection against unreasonable search and seizure. Obviously, we have talked at length about everything akin to opening mail without a warrant and about section 15, which provides that every individual is equal before the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921662">There was a risk of arbitrary discrimination. I could not find a single organization or agency that had anything good to say about the parts that were removed from Bill C‑2. That is why we are discussing and debating Bill C‑12 today. I could not find anyone to defend those parts because they represented a potential for intrusion. One very well-known expert witness told me that parts 14 and 15 of Bill C-2 would spell the end of privacy. If those provisions were not amended, it would have been the end of privacy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921663">The government clearly took its shot, but it wrote this in a hurry. What scares me is that if the Liberal government had won a majority, Bill C-2 would have been passed and rammed down the throats of Quebeckers, Canadians and the opposition, all because the Americans felt it was very important. However, they do not value privacy as highly as we do here in Quebec and Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8921664">That is scary, because there is no guarantee that Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C‑2</Document> will not be brought back to life. Parts of that legislation can still be found in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C‑12</Document>. The minister has not given up hope of getting the highly contentious parts of Bill C‑2 passed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921665">What matters is that the opposition did its job. The government realized that it did not do its job properly, that it had rushed things and had been too hasty in introducing Bill C‑2, which did not at all meet the needs of Quebeckers and the people of the other provinces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921666">Bill C‑12 was pared down, because it is better to have something than nothing at all. This bill does have some interesting parts, which we would like to explore. We in the Bloc Québécois do not simply oppose or criticize. As a political party, we truly want to improve things and propose ideas, especially when they are in the interest of Quebec. All the better if they are also in the interest of other Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921667">When it comes to the whole issue of border security, the Bloc Québécois has long been calling for stronger action. We know that it took the President of the United States to tell us that our border is like a sieve. The Speaker of the House will surely recall that, at the time, we were very critical of the fact that the Liberal government opened Roxham Road and that we were told that we were racist and unwelcoming to refugees. Slowly but surely, Ontario came around to our way of thinking, as did the other provinces, and all of a sudden, the government managed to solve the problem and began welcoming refugees through the proper points of entry.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921668">The Bloc Québécois also made suggestions about how to better monitor the borders and better protect citizens. The first was to create a department of borders. I asked the minister questions at the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security two weeks ago, but instead of answering me, he looked to the president of the CBSA to answer for him. That is rather unfortunate. He needs to be accountable. This is his responsibility, and he needs to answer the questions. Given the current context, we think it is high time that the government incorporated a border department into this department, where all security interventions are entrusted to a minister who is responsible and accountable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921669">We also proposed a measure that we believe could improve border security. We propose that border officers be given more flexibility in performing their duties. On Friday, I visited the school where Canadian border officers are trained. The training centre is located in Rigaud, in the riding of my neighbour from <Affiliation DbId="318044" Type="2">Vaudreuil</Affiliation>. I had a wonderful time seeing first-hand the serious training provided to border officers and the highly-qualified personnel it produces in all matters related to border security. Why not let these officers respond to situations as they arise, leave their post, perform interceptions and call the RCMP to come and deal with packages, shipments or people trying to enter Canada illegally?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921670">I fail to understand the government's resistance to this proposal, since not a single border officer would deny that it is a good idea. In times of limited resources, it is wise to use our resources as effectively as possible. That is an idea proposed by the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921671">The Bloc Québécois also continues to demand better control of firearms that are circulating illegally and are prohibited on our soil. I represent a riding that borders the Akwesasne reserve, Lake Saint‑François, Lake Saint‑Louis, and the U.S. border in New York state. We know there is trafficking of illegal arms. We are therefore asking for more patrols and more resources to be allocated to this part of the country, where we know there is a lot of smuggling and even human trafficking, which occurs more by waterways than by land.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8921672">We will continue to demand oversight to clean up the Toronto big banks and money laundering activities linked to criminal groups. We will also propose tougher penalties for border smugglers. The current penalties are a joke. We have even seen smugglers get caught and deported back to their countries, only to return to Quebec and resume the same criminal activities. Our border control system is clearly dysfunctional.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921673">Obviously, we also want to take action in the fight against the fentanyl crisis, which, as everyone knows, is a public health crisis. In the Bloc Québécois, we agree that we need to invest in public health, which means increasing federal health transfers. The government must be more attentive to the needs of Quebec and the provinces in terms of support and funding, whether for rehabilitation centres, rapid access to emergency rooms, social worker services, supervised consumption centres, or harm reduction initiatives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921674">The Bloc Québécois believes that border measures to crack down on organized crime continue to be not only necessary, but extremely important. In addition, we must have seamless co-operation among American, Mexican and Canadian authorities so they can be more effective in their response and capture the criminals, who have had it easy for the past few years. These criminals have figured out the flaws in our system and learned how to take advantage of them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921675">Of course, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C‑12</Document> also deals with the issue of refugee claimants. If the bill is sent to the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, we will have an opportunity to debate it there and get a better idea of the sections that amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921676">I must say that the Bloc Québécois has some questions about Bill C‑12. Under the bill, rail companies will have to create a space in their marshalling yards, including a warehouse and offices, because right now customs officers are unable to inspect railway cars leaving Canada for the United States. To do that, rail companies such as CN, CP and CSX will have to build infrastructure in their marshalling yards. The big question I have is this: Are those rail companies going to have to cover 100% of the costs associated with setting up this infrastructure?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921677">For example, it could cost millions of dollars to set up infrastructure that includes a warehouse and two or three offices for border officers, as well as a scanning system to detect if cars contain explosives or other important illicit substances that could threaten national security. I do not have the exact figure, but it could be more than $30 million. I know this because it is what is required at the Port of Valleyfield for border officers to be present and for containers to clear through the port. Will the rail companies also be required to set up this very expensive infrastructure? Will they receive financial support? Will they have a certain amount of time to comply with the new requirements?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921678">As is often the case in legislation, the devil is in the details, and yet the current text of Bill C‑12 is lacking in this level of detail. In committee, we will have an opportunity to hear from many witnesses. For example, CN officials may tell us that this is not a problem, that they are willing to invest several million dollars in their marshalling yards to ensure that the agency has the infrastructure it needs to inspect the rail cars. I may be a pessimist but, given the times we are living in, I question whether a rail company would want to invest so much money in order to meet a government request. I suspect that enforcement delays may be much longer than what is anticipated in the context of the bill.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8921679">In terms of rail companies, allowing border agents to come into marshalling yards to conduct inspections is a new way of doing things. Practices are going to change as a result. Ultimately, with Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C‑12</Document>, the government is announcing a lot of changes today. A law can be changed, but it can take several months or even years before the law is implemented and practices on the ground actually change. There are bills that were passed two years ago that we still do not have regulations for. The Official Languages Act is a good example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921680">Bill C‑12 also provides for changes to the mandate of the Canadian Coast Guard. As we know, the Coast Guard is responsible for patrolling various parts of Quebec and the provinces by water, but it does not have the authority to relay information to other authorities. It is not allowed. I do not know if it does so in practice, but it is not supposed to. This bill therefore corrects that by giving the Coast Guard the ability to help document information it deems suspicious.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921681">Since the Coast Guard has been moved back under the military budget, what we are wondering is whether Coast Guard officers will be armed and how much they will be able to intervene. I did not see anything in the bill to indicate whether that might change. It is rather odd to be part of the armed forces but to not be allowed to be armed. That is another question. We can have that debate during committee hearings when we study the bill more thoroughly. As long as we do not know the answers to these questions, if the Coast Guard's only mandate is to provide information and surveillance, then we have to wonder whether it will truly be integrated under the umbrella of the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921682">I think everyone knows that this is needed first and foremost for the Arctic, to safeguard the border and protect Canada's territorial sovereignty. However, as a member of Parliament representing an area near Lac Saint-François that also borders the Akwesasne reserve and New York State, what I am seeing is a decrease of at least 50% in maritime patrols in that area. The government talks about adding resources, but I think it is more a question of managing resources. The government is going to take resources away from the Coast Guard, give it a little more power and move its officers to priority areas, thereby neglecting other areas, including areas in my riding, which is a hot spot for gun smuggling, tobacco smuggling and human trafficking.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921683">For the past year or year and a half, the government has been making one announcement after another. I think this is the fifth official announcement of plans to hire 1,000 border officers. Hiring 1,000 new officers takes a lot of organization; after all, border officers do not grow on trees. It takes at least 18 weeks to train them, not including the specialized training delivered at various campuses in Quebec and Canada. What is less clear in the bill is who will be training them. Do we have enough instructors? Are the 1,000 officers really going to be assigned to the border? It seems not. Instead, we hear that 800 border officers will be trained at Rigaud and another 200 will be assigned to intelligence or administrative investigation duties. These are some of the areas we will have to clarify when we ask questions in committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921684">In closing, we obviously intend to take a serious and thorough approach to Bill C-12. We are going to help improve it, and we hope that the governing party will listen to our amendments and recommendations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8921692">Madam Speaker, I tend to agree with the first part of my colleague's question; it is true that workers are losing their jobs right now because of American tariffs. It does not seem as though the government is acting very quickly to support the small regions and medium-sized businesses that do not have the cash flow they need to cope with these changes. Quite frankly, we had very high expectations of this Liberal government based on what we heard during the election campaign. Unfortunately, we have been very disappointed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921693">Take, for example, the aerospace industry and secondary processing facilities. There have been closures and staffing cuts in my riding and across Quebec. Unfortunately, the government is not paying much attention to that and does not seem to be acting very quickly. The government is not very quick on the draw, as they say. It is not very quick to respond to communities' urgent and pressing needs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921694">The most problematic parts of Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C‑2</Document>, namely, the privacy invasions, were taken out of Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C‑12</Document>. Bill C‑2 was completely unacceptable. Canadians, Quebeckers, all organizations and everyone were against the fact that the government would allow such a major invasion of the privacy of Quebeckers and Canadians. When the government saw that its bill would not make it any further than this if it did not make amendments, it finally listened to reason and introduced Bill C‑12, which removed the three most problematic parts of Bill C‑2.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8921697">First, the reason why Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C‑2</Document> was introduced so early on is that it was an urgent matter for the government. Donald Trump forced the government to improvise, and Canadians are under a lot of pressure in the climate of fear and insecurity that he is creating. However, with the new Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the government is removing mail searches, privacy invasions and restrictions on cash transactions for charities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921698">How will the U.S. President react to that? Are we expecting the United States to retaliate? I am curious to hear what my colleague thinks will be the consequences of removing these two clauses. They were problematic, and I do not think anyone wanted to see them in a bill. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8921700">I agree that the U.S. President's team must be disappointed, given that the U.S. government did not get what it asked for. The Liberal government backed down on a number of decisions that were made in the House to please the U.S. government, in the hopes that it would have some impact on the tariffs that were imposed. Unfortunately, that strategy has not worked so far.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921701">As we know, businesses continue to be impacted by the tariffs. I think that Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C‑12</Document> is a first step. I am sure that, in private discussions between the U.S. the President and our <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, there is talk of trying again to get us to pass Bill C-2, which contains three parts, including mail searches and the serious violation of the privacy rights of Quebeckers and Canadians. I think it is only a matter of time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921702">I urge everyone to be very vigilant because that is what the U.S. President really wants. I think that we can only conclude that the current Liberal government will do everything it can to satisfy the American administration.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8921706">I would say that, to calm things down a bit, the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> should make it clear that the three troubling parts that were removed from Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="“3”">C-12</Document> need to be scrapped for good.

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8921709">Madam Speaker, as I indicated in my question, I appreciate many of the comments the member from the Bloc party has raised here this afternoon. I think this is very much a responsible approach to deal with the legislation that we have before us. I can assure the member that many of the concerns and questions she has raised will no doubt be talked about extensively during the committee process. Hopefully, the member will be able to get the answers she is looking for.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921710">Obviously, we have a minister who is committed to getting the legislation through. I appreciate the frankness and the manner in which the Bloc appears to be supporting the legislation. Ultimately, we will have to wait and see what sort of priority the opposition, collectively, will put on this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921711">It is important for us to recognize, right at the beginning, why legislation of this nature has become such a priority. Canada's new <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, along with the cabinet, members of the Liberal caucus and others, understands that things have changed a great deal over the past year. We have seen great emphasis put on the border between Canada and the United States. Border security concerns have been elevated to a degree I have not seen in my many years of being a parliamentarian. We have a prime minister who recognizes just how important it is that the government act quickly to address a number of those concerns. That is the reason why Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> was introduced as early as it was. The Prime Minister was amplifying just how important border control is because of some of the crimes being committed in Canada. He has made it a priority in Bill C-2.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921712">In listening to the many comments thus far, both from the Bloc and the Conservatives, I can appreciate that there are aspects of Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> they are concerned about to the degree where the legislation was not receiving the type of support that can see it go to committee in a quick fashion. In fact, I believe we had just over 18 hours of actual debate on Bill C-2.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921713">There are some issues within Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> that are somewhat contentious, and concerns have been raised about them. However, just because they are not necessarily incorporated in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, which we are debating today, it does not take away from the importance of other measures in Bill C-2. It is important that we recognize it is not just the government's opinion but also that of stakeholders, particularly law enforcement agencies. We recognize there are many aspects of Bill C-2 that address concerns Canadians justifiably want to see some form of action taken on.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921714">To those who have been following Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, the government is not saying no. It recognizes that we need to get other aspects incorporated into Bill C-2 to move it more quickly through the House of Commons. We believe that the legislation we are proposing today deals with these concerns to a degree where we will hopefully see the bill get to the committee stage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921715"> We need to take a look at the changing dynamic that Canada is facing today, compared to where it was a year ago. One only needs to look at the last national election in the United States. President Trump has made it very clear that he has concerns on a number of fronts with respect to Canada and Mexico. He wants to see specific actions taken in order to foster more co-operation, if I could put it that way.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8921716">I will use the issue of fentanyl as an example. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921717">The United States says that fentanyl coming from Canada into the United States is a huge problem. I believe that what is being brought into the United States is less than 1%, but we still take it seriously. The <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been very clear about the impact fentanyl is having not only in our communities but also in other nations. He recognizes the impact that drugs coming into Canada is having.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921718">Back in late spring, the government attempted to address concerns expressed on many occasions about how Canada Post was obligated to deliver first-class mail, or size 10 envelopes, which are just standard envelopes. Canada Post was being used to distribute fentanyl in my province and in particular in northern communities. This is a legitimate concern that comes from stakeholders in rural Manitoba. The government responded by ensuring there are more checks in place to minimize the amount of fentanyl going through Canada Post. That is the goal. The <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, cabinet and the Liberal caucus want to see less fentanyl in our communities. Whether it is through Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> or Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, and our talking about the principles of these, this is what we are hoping to accomplish. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921719">Stronger borders is another issue that has been of great concern in the last 12 months. Actually, it has been less than 12 months. Again, we have the newly elected <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He was elected back in April. He has committed not only legislation but also budgetary measures to this. A budget is coming on November 4. We often receive questions about RCMP officers, Canada border control officers and the commitment the Prime Minister has made. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921720">It is no small commitment. The <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> says that we are serious about securing Canada's borders. This means not only bringing in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, which would provide extra strength, but also factoring in 1,000 new RCMP officers and 1,000 new border control officers. This is a significant commitment that goes over and above the legislation. As a government, we recognize that we can bring forward legislation and that, in this situation, there is a need to put more boots on the ground. This is something that will be materializing. I suspect we will hear more about that on November 4, when we present the fall budget to Canadians through the House of Commons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921721">The legislative component is absolutely critical. The sharing of information is so important. Things have changed over the years. We all know that, through technology and the advancement of the Internet, there are things that can be done through the Internet with all the different types of weapons out there. I am not just talking about guns. Weapons can take many different forms. There is a need for legislation of this nature.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8921722">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> has two pillars. The first is securing the border and the second is combatting transnational organized crime in terms of things like illegal fentanyl and illicit financing. These are the types of issues being dealt with in this legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921723">I want to recognize the efforts of our border control officers. There are interesting statistics, which we always like to talk about. Whether it is the RCMP or our border control officers, I do not think we give them enough credit for the fine work they do. When I say “we”, I am talking about parliamentarians as a whole and, even beyond the House of Commons, provincial politicians. To give a sense of the type of work that border control officers do for us, I will provide some statistics from January 1 to September 19 of this year. These are all seizures by the Canada border security agents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921724"> Regarding cannabis products, somewhere in the neighbourhood of 37,467,000 grams were seized. For hashish, it was 379,000 grams. For cocaine or crack, it was 2,702,000 grams. For heroin, it was 73,946 grams. There were 770,534 grams of other opioids and 22,237,913 grams of other types of drugs seized. With regard to firearms, something that is constantly discussed, 662 firearms and 11,119 prohibited weapons were seized. In terms of hard dollars, it amounted to $29,961,000. In suspected proceeds of crime, the amount was $2,919,000. This work was done in the first nine months of the year. That is why I say the work our Canada border control officers do for us is so critically important, as is the RCMP's.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921725">I asked the Conservative shadow minister or critic a very specific question related to the RCMP. I want to raise this because I take it very seriously, as I know Canadians do. When I posed my question to the Conservative opposition critic, he chose to sidestep the issue and not answer. It is the same question I posed to the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> responsible for introducing Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, and it is in relation to the RCMP.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921726">I am offended because, over the last number of days, there has been a lot of news and social media coverage about a statement the <Affiliation DbId="322132" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> made. The Winnipeg Free Press said that the leader of the Conservative Party called the leadership of the RCMP “despicable”. That is a very important issue in this debate. The government says it is going to increase security at our border, reinforce the strength of the RCMP by investing in another 1,000 officers and that we should, collectively, support those two institutions.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8921727">As I indicated, the RCMP as an institution is recognized around the world as a first-class security and law enforcement agency. Let there be absolutely no doubt about that. A politician who says that the leadership of the RCMP is despicable, and goes on in great detail, does a disservice not only to the institution of the RCMP but to all of us who sit inside the House, let alone if it is the <Affiliation DbId="322132" Type="9">leader of Canada's official opposition</Affiliation> making that statement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921728">That is why I posed the question earlier to my colleague across the way from the Conservative Party, who was appointed by the <Affiliation DbId="322132" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation> to take on the role of shadow minister: Does he support what the leader of the Conservative Party is saying? I respect, to a certain degree, that the member chose not to answer the question. I suspect that he understands why it was not an appropriate thing for the leader of the official opposition to say. I believe that the leader of the official opposition owes an apology to all Canadians on this issue. What is despicable, and I would add a few other words to that, is the damage that it causes when the leader of the official opposition makes comments of that nature. I would suggest that the leader of the official opposition owes a sincere apology inside the House to all Canadians for saying what he has said.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921729">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would amend the accelerated scheduling pathway that allows precursor chemicals that can be used to produce illicit drugs to be rapidly controlled by the <Affiliation DbId="318692" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>. This would allow law and border enforcement agencies to take swift action to prevent the illegal importation and use of precursor chemicals and would at the same time ensure strict federal oversight over any legitimate use of these chemicals. The legislation would also provide more strength in terms of the anti-terrorist-financing regime, including through stronger anti-money-laundering penalties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921730">With respect to the substance of the legislation, the Bloc member referred to the Coast Guard, saying that the Coast Guard would have expanded responsibility. I believe that the sharing of information that a Coast Guard can receive can be exceptionally valuable in terms of the security of our nation. As a result, I agree that there need to be checks in place related to privacy and actions that would not adhere to our Constitution, but at the end of the day, that is valuable information and I would suggest that this information, if accessed appropriately, can ultimately save lives and a whole lot more. That is the reason some of the initiatives Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would bring in add more value to the legislation. It becomes a question of whether we want to see that sharing of information, either with the Coast Guard or with immigration.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8921731">If I had another 20 minutes, I could go into detail as to why we need to protect the integrity of the system and to be able to recognize that there is abuse within the system and that there is the potential for significant abuse. These amendments are absolutely critical for dealing with the issue of asylum, for example.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921732">Many issues that I have, whether they are related to asylum or other issues related to security, can best be addressed in one-on-one discussions and debates and by the presenters who go before the standing committee.</ParaText>

Civil society as a whole stood up and spoke out, and many people have contacted members from all parties to express their concerns. If these parts of the bill are so important, as the parliamentary secretary said, then we need to talk about them, educate people and make sure everyone understands them.

The <Affiliation DbId="318691" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> suggested she thinks it is constitutional.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921747">My concern is that if we have all these groups saying it is unconstitutional when the <Affiliation DbId="318691" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> thinks it is constitutional, and there are no other provisions to deal with the massive backlog of asylum claims, then how is the Liberal government going to functionally reduce the asylum claim backlog? What I am worried about with the bill is that the Liberals are just punting the problem to the courts and potentially past the next election date, as opposed to making a serious structural reform that would reduce the incentive for economic migrants to abuse Canada's asylum system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921748">Could my colleague comment on the fact that many groups have said it is unconstitutional when the <Affiliation DbId="318691" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> has said it is constitutional, and this is likely an attempt by the Liberal government to punt the asylum claim system problem to the courts?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8921749">Mr. Speaker, I find it a bit surprising that the Conservatives, while in opposition, are really concerned about constitutional issues and the charter when it comes to the government bringing in laws, because they sure were not concerned before. When the member sat around with the Harper government, they were not at all concerned about these issues. Court rulings have demonstrated that the government is very much aware of the issues facing the immigration system today, including asylum seekers and potential asylum seekers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921750">The legislation is very important in terms of protecting the integrity of the system. I understand the issue in great detail in regard to the immigration file and the issues around asylum. I understand why there is a problem. It is not just Ottawa.

It is probably the thing I have heard him speak about most. The reality is that our country is a relatively new country. Other than those of indigenous descent, we have all immigrated here over about the last two hundred years.

              <ParaText id="8921754">Mr. Speaker, I truly appreciate the question. I have been consistent over the years, as I believe the Liberal Party has, in regard to the true value of immigration. Let us contrast that to the far-right <Affiliation DbId="322132" Type="9">leader of the Conservative Party</Affiliation>. The far-right leader of the Conservative Party goes against, I would argue, many of the thoughts prairie MPs would have regarding some of the statements he has made publicly. This anti-immigrant messaging coming from the Conservative Party's leadership is very concerning.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8921755">As an example, I would challenge my Manitoba colleagues in the Conservative Party. We have a province that desperately wants to retain people who are on working visas and people who have working visas that are expiring. My Conservative colleagues from Manitoba know that, yet they sit on their hands and are quiet when we have rural communities in Manitoba advocating for something their <Affiliation DbId="322132" Type="9">leader</Affiliation> is saying no to. That is irresponsible leadership coming from the Conservative Party, whether it is immigration or even the issue of the RCMP, and I'll save that for another time.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8922004">The petition draws attention to the good work of the water soldier working group, which is chaired and led by the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters. This week, it will be hosting an information session in my riding. </ParaText>

Under current law, authorities have some authority to act, but ambiguity and weak enforcement have left cities throughout Canada hesitant to dismantle these camps. The government's reckless soft-on-crime approach and radical drug policies have allowed this crisis to spread unchecked across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922009">The petitioners are asking the government to amend the Criminal Code to provide clear and unequivocal authority for law enforcement to dismantle illegal encampments; ensure that police are empowered to act quickly and decisively to restore public order; end the failed policies of safe supply and decriminalization, which have only worsened the addiction crisis and undermine public safety; and finally, support real recovery by investing in treatment and rehab programs, not policies that perpetuate drug use. </ParaText>

Right now, with the cost of living in Canada, they are asking for more of their personal belongings from Ukraine to be shipped here. The European Union has recognized this and has implemented a 150-euro limit to allow them to bring in more goods from home as needed. </ParaText>

It is a global threat that is here in Canada. The petitioners note that our government is not taking the steps that have been taken in the European Union, which is following the precautionary principle.

The online portal cannot resolve complex issues, and many are left waiting hours on hold, only to have calls dropped or accounts locked. They cite that, since the previous Conservative government closed many offices and the Liberal government cut thousands of workers, services have deteriorated dramatically and Canadians often wait weeks or months without help, while even MPs and their staff struggle to assist constituents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922017">The petitioners urge the government to increase staffing, restore in-person options, fix technical barriers and ensure complex cases are resolved promptly. Canadians deserve accessible, reliable service.</ParaText>

This follows the announcement of General Motors that it intends to lay off 2,000 workers at its Oshawa plant in January. In Brampton, 3,000 workers are affected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922023">It was shocking to hear news of Stellantis' betrayal. Make no mistake, this is a betrayal. It is a betrayal of the thousands of workers who are directly involved and the thousands more indirectly so. It is a betrayal of both provincial and federal governments and the taxpayers who had supported Stellantis in exchange for an explicit commitment to manufacture vehicles in Brampton. This decision will have major repercussions across the country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8922035">Mr. Speaker, Canada's asylum system is deeply and fundamentally broken after 10 years of Liberal government. This was not the case 10 years ago, but today, Canada's once compassionate asylum claim system has been absolutely ruined, absolutely abused and absolutely made a mess of by the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922036">Today, I rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>. I will direct my comments to parts 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the bill, which would amend the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Act as well as the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. These parts are similar to the immigration provisions contained in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922037">A decade ago, Canada's asylum claim backlog sat at less than 10,000 cases. Today, that backlog sits at several hundred thousand cases, with thousands more claims being made every month. While there are many highly persecuted persons around the world who are legitimately seeking refuge in Canada, there are many claims currently in that massive backlog that are bogus. Those claims are taking years, not months or weeks, to process, and worse, even after being found to be a bogus claim, an applicant can appeal their process for years more and then not be deported for years after that, if they are deported at all. During this time, bogus claimants can draw social benefits that Canadians do not have access to, such as vision care.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922038">In effect, over the last decade, the Liberal government has allowed Canada's asylum system to veer far away from the original principles of its design and turned it into a backdoor, skip-the-line, economic migration stream, which is not accounted for at all in federal immigration levels planning, including the impact on housing supply, health care access and jobs. The Liberal failure has had many negative impacts, which I will outline today, with the two most noteworthy being the destruction of the fairness and compassion of Canada's asylum system and, in turn, the inability of the system to prioritize the world's most vulnerable persons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922039">When the <Affiliation DbId="318691" Type="4">Minister of Immigration</Affiliation> claimed that the immigration provisions contained in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, and now in this bill, would do something about this problem, she said it “would improve the flexibility and responsiveness of the asylum system”. However, in reality, the immigration provisions of this bill are structured to do one thing, which is to shift the responsibility for addressing Canada's deeply broken asylum system to the courts and away from the Liberal government that broke it in the first place, potentially past the horizon of the next election. As such, it is my assessment that the immigration provisions in the bill are likely to fail without substantive amendment and additional measures to both reduce the incentive for economic migrants to abuse the asylum system, to swiftly remove bogus asylum claimants from Canada, and to restructure this asylum system to ensure that the world's most vulnerable persons do not continue to be let down by the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922040">I will now demonstrate to colleagues and the IRCC bureaucrats listening in the government lobby why this failure is likely to occur and what changes must be made. To begin, it is important to understand the extent to which Canada's asylum system is broken and how we got to this point because we cannot fix something if we do not understand what the problem is. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922041">In 2017, the leader of the Liberal government tweeted, “#WelcomeToCanada”, in a tweet that was designed to encourage failed asylum claimants in the United States whose temporary protected status had been revoked by a due process to come to Canada instead, and come they did. After that tweet, well over 100,000 people illegally crossed the border into Canada and claimed asylum, many in spite of the fact that they did not have valid asylum claims in the United States, which is considered to be a safe third country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922042">Said differently, if somebody had a failed asylum claim in the United States, they never should have been allowed to claim asylum in Canada after illegally crossing the borders, but the Liberals opened the floodgates in 2017, even putting up infrastructure at the illegal border crossing most used, Roxham Road, and instructing RCMP officers to help people with their baggage. In many instances, scammers, unscrupulous consultants and even human traffickers exploited the system at the expense of the integrity and compassion of Canada's asylum system and the safety of all involved. The Liberals encouraged this for years.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="35">(1535)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8922043">I have been standing in this place for years now saying this and here we are. At that time, I remember the Liberals implied I was a racist for saying these things, and here we are with Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> in front of us because of this failure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922044">Well over 100,000 people have entered Canada illegally from the United States since 2015 and claimed asylum. Most have bogus claims, most are still in the processing queue, most have work permits and access to health care, and many have been put up for years in hotels at the taxpayers' expense.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922045">At the same time, the Liberals lifted visa requirements from countries that have had a long history of high levels of bogus asylum claims, like Mexico, without any plan in place to prevent those claims from skyrocketing again. At that time, I raised many concerns about this issue, which fell on deaf ears. It is unfortunate, because since that time, over 60,000 asylum claims have been made by Mexican nationals due largely to the visa lift. Most have bogus claims, most are still in the processing queues and many have abused the government's payment of hotel rooms for people. It is insane that we are here having this debate again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922046">Experts have raised concerns that there are likely many more asylum claims on the way from the record three million temporary residents the Liberals allowed into Canada over the past few years whose visas are about to expire. Social media posts have encouraged people to attempt to extend their temporary resident permits by making bogus asylum claims. The result is that Canada's asylum claim system is drowning in over 296,000 claims, with average processing times of 29 months or more. At current rates, estimates suggest it could take 25 years to clear the current inventory, while thousands more claims keep pouring in.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922047">The prolonged uncertainty and volume created by this backlog strain resources and people with valid claims alike. This backlog is failing the world's most vulnerable, who have real claims of persecution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922048">Nearly $1 billion has been spent by the Liberals on something called the interim federal health program, which provides benefits to asylum claimants that in some cases Canadians do not even have taxpayer-funded access to. Since the Liberal government came to power, the program has increased in cost by 1,200% because of the backlog in the asylum claim system. This is on top of the billions of dollars that have been spent on providing funding to house asylum claimants in hotels and affordable housing, many of whom are bogus, while Canadians struggle to afford rent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922049">A shocking number of claims do, in fact, appear to be bogus, with news reports revealing nearly identical stories in hundreds of applications under one immigration consultant who had coached them unscrupulously. They often originate from low-risk countries with high volumes of issued temporary visas, serving as a back door to extend stays after student or work permits expire. Loopholes abound: easy inland claims, fraudulent labour market impact assessments and consultants peddling fake persecution narratives for fast-tracked permanent residency. Lax enforcement and limited oversight of immigration consultants have massively exacerbated this problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922050">The determination process of these claims itself is inefficient, with inconsistent decisions that plague an already massively clogged system. Some experts suggest that the higher rates of acceptance in recent years are due to a desire by bureaucrats to rubber-stamp applications in an effort to clear the backlog. What does this type of action do instead? It incentivizes more abuse of the system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922051">Said differently, the Liberals' breaking of the asylum system is a direct affront to the principles behind the 1951 refugee convention, which aimed to protect individuals fleeing true persecution. It was never meant to support economic migration. Today, thanks to the Liberals, many of the claimants in Canada's system are trying to claim asylum for reasons far beyond what the scope of the Geneva Convention imagined or proposed, and most are likely economic migrants.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8922052">Now we find ourselves here with the provisions in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>. The provisions outlined herein would undoubtedly face, without question, charter challenges, and given the state of Canada's judiciary, they are likely to be struck down by the courts. Consequently, considering the Liberal government's history of not appealing court rulings on immigration matters, as evidenced by the events that precipitated the current federal bill, Bill <Document DbId="13546143" Type="3">C-3</Document>, this would probably result in a further clogging of Canada's already overburdened judicial system and the continued deterioration of the asylum system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922053"> Advocacy groups have claimed that Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> may precipitate tens of thousands of court cases. The Refugee Law Lab, for example, in its report on provisions inherited from Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, highlighted potential infringements on section 7 of the charter due to the one-year bar on refugee claims, as well as section 15 on equality rights. This group has also suggested that it is already planning empirical research for litigation. The Canadian Immigration Lawyers Association suggested that the immigration provisions in Bill C-12 could be challenged because the Governor in Council powers for mass revocation of immigration status risk violating section 7 by enabling arbitrary politically motivated actions. Amnesty International and a coalition of another 300 organizations suggested that the bill should be challenged for potentially violating section 8 of the charter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922054">For Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, which has provisions similar to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, the federal government's charter statement asserts that any engagements are justified under section 1 as proportionate for border security and safety. It also makes a bunch of other assertions and says that everything is fine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922055">Here is the thing. There is a massively vast gulf between legal lobbyists, who do not want any sort of boundaries on the abuse of the asylum system because they are financially motivated to make endless appeals by the big glut of people coming in and abusing the asylum system, and what the Liberals are saying would be charter-compliant. In fact, when I was at the immigration committee and asked some department officials what they thought about the charter compliance of the provisions in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> that are now in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, they were fairly silent on the matter, which told me everything I needed to know. This is the Liberals' “let the courts sort it out later” approach to a system that is massively broken. It will only lead to abuse of the system without massive amendment and other massive actions to reduce the intake of people and their incentivization to abuse the system. I can say one thing, though: This is definitely going to make lawyers and immigration consultants a lot richer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922056">After the Liberals established a reputation for not challenging court rulings, the ruling that precipitated Bill <Document DbId="13546143" Type="3">C-3</Document>, an unmitigated chain migration bill, was never challenged by the Liberals. They did not even bother to assert Parliament's supremacy on the laws that had been made in this place. They said, “No, this is good”, and we have all of these other potential problems with Bill C-3. Now, after the Liberals have refused to challenge that ruling, they are trying to say that all of the lobby groups that are saying this bill is not charter-compliant are somehow going to magically accept that it is charter-compliant and will somehow solve the problems, which I find ridiculous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922057">The other thing is that the Liberals have gone out of their way to eschew the validity of section 33 of the charter. What have they essentially done with that? Even though their history says they are not going to challenge immigration rulings and they know that every legal group in the country is saying that this bill will need a charter challenge review, the Liberals have said they are probably not going to do anything about it. Mark my words: I cannot wait to come back to this in the House a few years from now, or whenever it may be if this bill passes, and say I was right. What the Liberals are doing is punting this issue to the courts while the system continues to get worse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922058">The Economist magazine recently published an article entitled “Scrap the asylum system—and build something better” that stated, “Rich countries need to separate asylum from labour migration.” I agree. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is silent on several other measures that could restore order and fairness to Canada's asylum system right now. For example, the Liberals should immediately undertake a system-wide review of the benefits that asylum claimants receive, particularly bogus asylum claimants, those with claims that have been found to fail, with an eye to reducing the benefits that bogus asylum claimants receive, especially when they are benefits that Canadians themselves do not receive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922059">For example, did members know that bogus asylum claimants get taxpayer-funded vision care through the interim federal health program? I know a lot of Canadians who do not get that. Years of taxpayer-funded hotel stays for bogus asylum claimants while Canadians make ends meet serve as a draw for system abuse. These types of benefits must be reviewed, and where possible, they must be curtailed to prevent the abuse that further draws on the system.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8922060">Why is Canada, at this juncture, still accepting asylum claims originating from the G7 and other safe third countries? The Liberal government needs to give its head a shake if it believes that someone who is arriving in Canada after having reached the safety of the United Kingdom, Germany or Japan is fleeing persecution in the spirit of the refugee convention and should be allowed to stay in Canada for years on a pending claim receiving taxpayer benefits like free hotel rooms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922061">Also, Canada's laws regarding the removal of people with no legal right to be in Canada need to be enforced. Canada needs timely removals and anonymized but publicly released departure tracking, and we need to know how this is getting done within the CBSA. While hearings and immigration tribunals must be conducted in a timely and efficient manner to ensure that claimants receive a fair process, those who do not have valid claims must be swiftly removed from Canada if our laws require them to be. Otherwise, we will just keep incentivizing people to abuse the system, because there is no disincentive for them not to. This could mean ensuring the detention of offenders attempting to enter Canada undetected when conditions are met. Peace officers must be empowered to carry out their duties as set out in the law, and national security warrants must be issued and executed in a way that Canadians expect them to be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922062">We have seen reports that the Liberals have allowed foreign nationals with known criminal histories into the country. New rules are needed to ensure that those with serious criminal convictions are rendered inadmissible to our country. The Liberals also need to get serious about closing loopholes and backlogs that further overload the system and cause frustrating delays up and down the immigration system. Applications failing the physical presence requirements, false information and endless rights to appeal need to be modernized to ensure the system works for the folks who it is intended to serve: the world's most vulnerable. The existing inventory of asylum claims should be reviewed on a last-in, first-out basis, while the criteria for making new claims must be tightly narrowed to prevent the system from being abused by economic migrants.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922063">The Liberals could be pursuing new rules and engagement strategies for countries with high levels of asylum claims, particularly resulting from bogus asylum claims made by temporary resident visa holders whose visas have expired. Educational institutions that have profited off of massive and unsustainable numbers of foreign student visas could be made to pay fines and be held financially liable when their students on these permits make bogus asylum claims. When the asylum-claim backlog reaches a certain number of claims or approval rates, an automatic review of the system could be triggered to ensure that officials are not incentivized to rubber-stamp applications as opposed to making thorough and consistent decisions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922064">Asylum claimants could be made to prove that their claims were made in a timely manner, as opposed to having that responsibility fall on the government. We could reverse the onus. This would prevent fraudulent claims from being made long after someone arrived in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922065">Additionally, there are many reports of unscrupulous immigration consultants aiding and abetting the abuse of Canada's asylum system. Shame on the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants for rejecting a request to appear in front of our committee. We will be reinviting it. It is absolutely shameful what some of these consultants are doing. The fact that its executives left under mysterious circumstances and are not coming to our committee suggests that maybe it is time these consultants report to lawyers after all.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922066">Also, the government should pause the acceptance of new United Nations-selected, government-sponsored refugees and use those spots to find room for highly persecuted persons who are already in Canada and who the government has already made promises to, like those waiting for news through the Hong Kong pathways program, or Ukrainians in Canada, who the Liberals made promise to and have failed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922067">The reality is that there are hundreds of millions of people who want to move to Canada, but we do not have the housing, health care or jobs to support them all. Our immigration system must be fair and orderly to make consistent and smart decisions and to prioritize, especially in the asylum system, the world's most vulnerable persons. The Liberals have moved us far away from that. ln that context, with regard to the asylum system, careful decisions must be made to ensure that our asylum system prioritizes the world's most vulnerable, is immune to abuse and fixes the mess the Liberals have created.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922068">In the 30 seconds I have left, I will say this. The Liberal <Affiliation DbId="318691" Type="4">immigration minister</Affiliation> has not answered any of these questions. She has put this bill out, it has been massively denigrated by all sides of the public and she has not come up with a solution. I have solutions.

Our efforts to combat criminal networks must keep pace with the increasingly sophisticated nature of their operations. One thing this bill does is expand the CBSA's powers to inspect and detain goods destined for export in warehouses and transportation centres. That is a first. This measure will close a significant loophole that is being exploited by criminals to facilitate auto theft. We are committed to taking effective measures to curb auto theft.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922116">At the same time, the bill also expands the role of the Canadian Coast Guard so that it can conduct security patrols and gather intelligence. Our coasts will now be protected. These new security activities will help the Coast Guard enhance collective security by conducting surveillance and intelligence-gathering missions in addition to its current operations. It will also be able to exchange information with its security, defence and intelligence partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922117">Specifically, the bill would allow the Canadian Coast Guard to use its ships, helicopters, sensors, operations centres and land resources to collect, receive, share and analyze intelligence in order to strengthen our surveillance activities and our sovereignty. These actions will help protect Canada's vast coastlines and waterways, particularly in remote northern regions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922118">With its fleet and its wealth of maritime experience, the Canadian Coast Guard has all the tools it needs to make a significant contribution to Canada's security. It is already active from coast to coast to coast, on the Great Lakes and in the St. Lawrence Seaway.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8922119">This change will be particularly significant in the Arctic, where Canada can and must play a leadership role in a region undergoing rapid change due to growing global interests, increased maritime traffic and complex security risks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922120">This bill also seeks to directly combat the opioid crisis. The trafficking of illicit fentanyl and dangerous precursor chemicals in our country requires the rapid implementation of meaningful measures. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> will enable the Minister of Health and law enforcement and border agencies to take swift action to prevent the illegal importation and use of chemical precursors as they emerge. This is a meaningful measure that will save hundreds, if not thousands, of Canadian lives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922121">We are also significantly strengthening Canada's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regime to combat the illicit financing that fuels these activities. Bill C-12 increases administrative penalties and improves information sharing between federal financial institutions to prevent bad actors from profiting from their crimes. Its purpose is to crack down on criminals and individuals who seek to exploit our country's generous immigration system by importing new forms of crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922122">It is a matter of integrity and fairness. Some folks may have reservations about these measures, but I can assure the House today that Bill C-12 strikes the necessary balance between security and the protection of rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922123">We are equipping our agencies with modern tools, while ensuring that these measures comply with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922124">Bill C-12 addresses a number of immediate priorities that will have tangible and immediate effects on the safety of our communities and the integrity of our border. It is a clear, deliberate and necessary measure to protect our country. It sends a strong message that Canada will not tolerate people using our borders to engage in illegal activities. Our immigration system will be based on fairness, integrity and order.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922125">For all these reasons, I believe this bill deserves the unanimous support of all members of the House. Voting for this bill is a vote in favour of a more secure border, a stronger and fairer immigration system and, most importantly, safer communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922126">I want to reiterate that Canadians deserve to feel safe and be safe. I invite my hon. colleagues to support this bill quickly and unanimously.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8922142">Mr. Speaker, as always, it is a true pleasure for me to rise in the House to speak on behalf of the amazing residents and constituents of my constituency of Davenport. I will be speaking today to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, an act respecting certain measures relating to the security of Canada's borders and the integrity of the Canadian immigration system and respecting other related security measures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922143">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would make critical amendments that would keep Canadians safe and secure by providing law enforcement with the resources to disrupt increasingly complex criminal groups, by strengthening border security and by improving our immigration system while protecting privacy rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Of course, this legislation builds on a $1.3-billion investment in border security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922144">Before I go further, I want to recognize that we are gathered today on the traditional and unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922145">Whenever I am examining new legislation, I often ask myself a series of questions: Who is going to benefit from the bill? How will the legislation improve our immigration programs and services for newcomers? Will it improve government services and support? In reviewing the proposed amendments for the strengthening Canada's immigration system and borders act, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, I believe the answers are yes, yes and yes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922146">I believe this legislation strikes the right balance. It would improve how the government serves Canadians, newcomers and those seeking Canada's protection. The bill would also strengthen our security and safety, would support our economic growth with a more efficient and effective system, and would improve communication and co-operation among federal, provincial and territorial governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922147">The measures proposed in this bill are designed to improve our immigration and asylum systems to better meet the needs of our country and those needing our protection. It fits with our commitment to a more sustainable immigration system that is aligned with our capacity to absorb, employ and house newcomers. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922148">Canadians want our country's asylum system to uphold our proud humanitarian tradition and continue to be a beacon of hope and opportunity to the world's most vulnerable. At the same time, Canadians do not want our resources to be devoted to people who attempt to shortcut our immigration processes or abuse the generosity of our communities for their own personal gain. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922149">The legislation before us proposes a reasonable balance to managing claims for asylum, either at the border or in Canada, and would appropriately refer claims to the Immigration and Refugee Board for a decision. The bill would also improve the management of the asylum system with enhanced efficiencies in processing claims. For example, creating a single, online application process would make applications simpler and help with information sharing across the appropriate departments and agencies. This would make sure that cases are decision-ready when they are referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board. That would benefit asylum claimants waiting to know if they are eligible for Canada's protection. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922150">Under the legislation, the federal government would change how it manages specific asylum claims, including claims made more than one year after someone's first arrival in Canada, after June 24, 2020, and claims made by those who irregularly enter Canada, make a claim 14 or more days later and effectively avoid returning to the U.S. under the safe third country agreement. People will always be able to submit claims, which would not change with this legislation, and claims would not be dismissed. The claims would instead be referred to our fair and comprehensive removal process, which includes the ability to seek a pre-removal risk assessment. This would help reduce pressure on the asylum system and protect it against sudden increases in claims, while ensuring fair and fast consideration of claims of risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922151">These new rules would streamline the claims process. This would benefit asylum claimants, who right now are waiting way too long to have their cases reviewed and decided. Some of these people may have fled their home countries to live in a democratic and free country. They may have left to seek religious freedom. They may have come to Canada to live their preferred gender or identity. If they have made it to Canada and made an asylum claim, we want their claim to be processed in a timely and fair manner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922152">The measures in the bill would also support a closer working relationship between the federal government and the provinces and territories. Under the current legislation, the federal government shares some information, but gaps in our legal framework mean we often have to do so on a case-by-case basis.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8922153">It means that we would update sharing provisions to provide information on immigration, citizenship and passports to clients sooner. This would help all orders of government and our domestic partners to work together to get newcomers the services they need faster. I understand that this has been a request from our partners for some time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922154">We know that provinces and territories deliver so many of the important, on-the-ground services that newcomers, including asylum claimants, rely upon. In collaboration with the federal government and with our support, they provide much-needed access to health care and social programs. They are an important partner in the process of welcoming and integrating newcomers. Providing current and accurate information is essential for any productive partnership.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922155">Finally, I would like to say that the bill would improve how we would work together to better protect Canadians. At the end of the day, a main priority of Parliament and all orders of government is the safety and security of our citizens and residents.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922156">In recent years, we have seen human smugglers and organized crime groups attempt to guide people across our borders through irregular points of entry. The legislation, if passed, would propose that those trying to shortcut our immigration process by crossing irregularly into Canada and making an asylum claim would have their claims referred to the CBSA and not the Immigration and Refugee Board.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922157">There have been concerns raised that people are using multiple identities or different names to access benefits in Canada. This is simply not acceptable. By improving our information sharing among partners, we would help clarify the identity of anyone seeking to defraud our systems. The legislation also proposes that only hearing-ready claims would be forwarded for review by the Immigration and Refugee Board. That would give national security and law enforcement the time needed to conduct thorough background checks, confirm identities and examine any potential links to criminal history or activities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922158">Together, these measures would reassure Canadians that our systems are effective and that our borders are secure. That would help improve trust in our immigration system. I see clear benefits coming out of the legislation, benefits to our country's immigration system, including supporting the more efficient work of the federal government and all levels of government, and improving services for Canadians and newcomers. It would streamline decision-making, reduce efforts to bypass our migration programs and rules, and improve collaboration across all levels of government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922159">Rest assured, the bill is a key part of the government's forward-looking agenda. I urge my fellow hon. members from all sides of the House to join me in supporting the important legislation today. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8922171">I am very proud that our government, over the last 10 years, has not only invested about $1 billion in the border but has now made a number of legislative proposals to ensure the right legislation is in place to allow CBSA and RCMP officers to do their work. They have provided input into this bill. We have invested another $1.3 billion to ensure they have the resources they need. This is good value for money and we are working very closely with our international partners.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8922172">Mr. Speaker, it is my honour to stand here today on behalf of the citizens of Saskatoon West and speak to this bill, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>. I am going to speak mainly about the immigration aspects of this bill today. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922173">The first thing that comes to mind when I look at this bill is to question why we are here. What is it that has caused all this to happen? The member who just spoke mentioned changes that she thought happened. In reality, they were not things imposed upon us so much as they were created by the Liberal government. There are many things happening in our immigration system, at our borders and with crime in our country that can be traced directly to actions by the Liberal government over the last 10 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922174">If we go back to the previous Harper government, there were some very strong measures in place, such as mandatory minimums and consecutive police sentences. Police had the power to actually give consequences to criminals. Colleagues should know that crime was down. If they picture a <I>V,</I> when the Conservatives were in power before, violent crime was dropping, just like this side of the <I>V</I>. It was dropping significantly. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922175">Mysteriously, when the Liberals took over, violent crime went back up. Why? It was due to all of the changes they made to the laws that were lenient on criminals. Those were some of the things that were done. It was not that they were imposed on us from an outside force. Those changes had real consequences for the people of Saskatoon West. Now here we are with the government trying to fix something that it created in the first place, so do not be fooled by what we are hearing today. This is a cleanup of a mess that was made by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922176">I want to talk about immigration. As I start, I want to just highlight something I have noticed online and in communications I have had with people, Canadian voters, which is a bit of a disturbing trend of attitude toward newcomers, immigrants, in our country. As I said, there are a lot of problems, for sure. Everybody knows that our immigration system has many problems. We have a lot of crime in our country in general. We also have problems at our borders. There are lots of problems in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922177">Our immigration system is quite broken at the moment, for sure, but that does not mean it is the fault of newcomers to our country. I think that all of us in this room and anyone watching need to be reminded that unless someone is an indigenous person in this country, that they are an immigrant. We all come from that background. My grandparents were immigrants to this country, so I guess I would be a second-generation born in Canada, which makes me a third-generation immigrant in Canada. I am sure many of us have the same story.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922178">It is really important to remember that what is happening in our country right now in immigration is not the fault of newcomers who have come here. It all started back in 2017 when then prime minister Justin Trudeau made his famous tweet that basically said, “Welcome to Canada”. That told people all around the world that Canada wanted everybody to come here. Guess what happened? People responded. Many people came. They responded by selling their homes and leaving their families, by leaving everything behind and coming to Canada because Canada wanted them. The prime minister himself said that Canada wanted them. In reality, former prime minister Justin Trudeau did that without having any clue as to how he was going to deal with that, how many people were going to respond and what would happen to those who responded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922179">I come back to the broken system that we have now. If a person is feeling anger toward immigration in our country, that anger needs to be directed where it belongs, to the Liberal government that was in power and still is in power. The Liberal government had the chance to set the rules. In some cases it chose to not make rules. It set the numbers. It decided how many millions of people could come in as temporary residents. The government invited people in peril, like people from Hong Kong, Ukraine and Sudan, to come to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922180">In fact, just this morning I was reading a story about a family from Ukraine who has been here for a number of years through the CUAET program and now the family members are having trouble getting their visas, getting anything moving forward. In the story it says the humanitarian and compassionate stream, which is where Ukrainian people would fit in, faces waits of up to 50 years. It also says that for caregivers it is up to nine years, for the agri-food stream it is 19 years and for entrepreneurs under the start-up visa stream it is 35 years. These are ridiculous numbers. How can somebody who was invited to come to our country expect to wait 50 years to get permanent residency in our country? That is part of the brokenness that we see in this system.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8922181">Of course, the Liberal government created this mixed up immigration system. It used to be a very clean system in which we were looking for people with skills to bring to our country, in addition to family members and in addition to asylum seekers and refugee claimants. It was based on skills primarily, and now that has been changed to include all kinds of other political things in the numbers, so that people are admitted to Canada not just because of their skills but also because of other reasons that have nothing to do with their talents or their skills.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922182">Of course we all know what has happened in our temporary resident population, whether it is temporary foreign workers or students. There were absolutely no checks on the number of students coming into our country, and as a result, people took advantage of the system. Colleges took advantage of the system. There were many unscrupulous immigration consultants who took advantage of the system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922183">Ultimately, regarding refugees and asylum seekers, the system collapsed. There were so many people coming in that the system just could not handle it. Even with some increases that were made by the government, we ended up with ridiculous wait times of four years or longer for asylum claimants in Canada. This is the system that the Liberals created in Canada, so anyone who feels any negativity toward immigration in our country needs to put that on the Liberal government. The Liberals are the ones who created it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922184">Michael Barutciski from the MacDonald-Laurier Institute said this: “The explosion in asylum claims post-Roxham is the result of two simultaneous policy decisions: (1) loosening the criteria for visa issuance and (2) allowing visa-free travel for potential asylum seekers...our quiet asylum crisis is largely a self-inflicted problem.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922185">Of course, right on cue, the people looking to profit from these kinds of situations marched right in. There are fake immigration consultants or immigration consultants who bent the rules to make a lot of money from the situation. Human traffickers are literally bringing people into our country to work, to make money off their backs. That is human trafficking. Employers are taking advantage of temporary workers, and people were able to set up fake colleges and make lots of money off the backs of people coming into our country. At the end of the day, it was all about money. There was a lot of money to be made through the messed up system that was created by the government. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922186">Now here we are with Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, which is trying to fix some of this, and it would fix the big mess that was created by the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922187">Similarly, border security has become a big problem in our country. Everybody remembers Roxham Road. Roxham Road should have been a wall. People should not have been able to cross at Roxham Road, but instead it was convenient, because there was a road from New York and a road from Quebec, so people started crossing at Roxham Road, and the government could have simply stopped that. It could have put up a little fence. It could have discouraged people from coming across, but instead it put RCMP and CBSA officers there and essentially asked them to help people come into Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922188">They had a strange thing to say to them: “You are not allowed to cross here, but may I help you come into Canada?” How did that make any sense? They were literally helping people, carrying their luggage and bringing them across the border. Once in Canada, they were given pretty good treatment as asylum seekers. In fact, in that area it became very common for taxis to drop people off. They would come across the road, and a whole industry popped up on the Canadian side of the border related to newcomers coming into our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922189">Essentially, our RCMP and CBSA officers became “welcome to Canada” greeters, and more and more people came. This is what happens when we have a broken system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922190">Even on other parts of our border, there is a tremendous lack of technology. There is technology today that can scan containers and find what is in them; it can see exactly what is there, yet we have very little of this technology. We have not invested where we need to invest, and we do not have the people to do the checks that need to be done. As a result, a lot of stolen vehicles are coming into our country through container loads. There are a lot of drugs, and also the precursor chemicals that are used to make drugs, coming in unchecked, because we are doing a very poor job of checking what is coming into our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922191">Of course, there are guns. There are a lot of illegal guns coming across the border that are used in crimes in Canada, and we should be checking more of those things, which we are not doing, so there is a gap in our system that has not been corrected by the government but needs to be.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8922192">There is fairly unorganized enforcement of our border. There are a lot of agencies. There is the Canada Border Services Agency, CBSA; the RCMP; the immigration department, IRCC; the Immigration and Refugee Board, IRB; and the Coast Guard, among others, that patrol and monitor our border. It is not the members, the hard-working men and women who work for these organizations, who are the problem, but there is a lot of disorganization in these organizations. There is a lack of resources and even a lack of information sharing. These groups are not really allowed, because of privacy legislation, to share information from one organization to another, so we end up with a lot of duplicated work that is needed in order to solve crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922193"> These are just some of the things that are missing in the system that we currently have, which is the system that has been created and fine-tuned by the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922194">Last week, there was a very funny tweet, I thought. With all the problems of drugs and all the other things that are going on at the border, such as the illegal guns coming across and even human trafficking, what the Canada Border Services Agency is focused on, or at least last week was focused on, is this: “We’re taking action to protect our economy. CBSA is investigating whether certain imports of disposable paper plates, bowls, and platters from China are being sold at unfair prices in Canada (dumped) or subsidized.” This is the priority of CBSA today, with all the other things that are happening. It is embarrassing for me as a Canadian to see that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922195">Of course, surveillance at the border is not happening to any significant degree. The government made a big story about buying a couple of helicopters. Well, a couple of helicopters on a 7,000-kilometre border does not do a whole lot, and there is so much more than could be done with surveillance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922196">What happens? Organized criminals step in, which is the really negative aspect, because they see an opportunity to make money. International crime rings and cartels are using Canada as a base of operations for them to do all their nasty things and make a lot of money off us, and not just us, but off the U.S. as well. Drug smugglers are smuggling drugs into Canada and then into other countries from here. I spoke about gun smuggling, which is a huge market that happens at our border, as well as human trafficking. We should be severely focused on curtailing and stopping all of these things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922197">RCMP chief superintendent and director general, serious and organized crime and border integrity, Mathieu Bertrand, said, “We are aware that they [cartels] are a source of a lot of the illicit goods coming into Canada. These organized crime groups, whether they be in Canada or abroad, are using Canada as a trans-shipment point. Those groups…are very much involved in crime impacting Canada.” I think that says it all, which is that a lot of the source of the crime comes from our lack of properly defending our border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922198">Of course, money laundering is another thing that happens in Canada regularly because we lack the tools and the ability to really see what is happening in that world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922199">As a result of all that, there is surging crime in Canada. We have heard this story many times. I spoke at the beginning about violent crime's decreasing over the Harper years, and then, in the Liberal years, it has gone right back up again because of the actions the Liberals have taken. Crime is up significantly under the Liberal government. Gang murders have doubled, and violent crime is up over 39%. The actions taken by the government have weakened the laws and effectively protected the criminal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922200">For example, Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> eliminated mandatory minimum sentences. As we look at the crimes that are being committed in our cities, and I see it in Saskatoon all the time, we see that there are very few consequences, if any, anymore for committing crimes. This has emboldened criminals. It has emboldened gangs to get young people involved in crime, because they know there are no consequences for committing those crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922201">This is partly because of Bill <Document DbId="11482450" Type="3">C-5</Document> where the mandatory minimums were taken away for significant offences such as human trafficking, drug trafficking, car theft and assault with a weapon. The list goes on. These are things for which the Liberal government chose to take away mandatory sentences, and as a result, there have been increases in these kinds of crimes. I guess the Liberals wanted to put criminals first and not put Canadians first. We need to restore mandatory sentences to put consequences for criminals back into the system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922202">The other bill that made a big change is Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>. Bill C-75 basically promoted house arrest. It essentially made it very difficult to put someone in jail. As a result, people are out on bail. That is why we talk about people getting bail instead of jail. We want to make sure that people actually go to jail and not always get bail. This is part of the catch-and-release problem that we have in our country, where people get arrested for a crime, are charged with a crime, get out on bail and can repeat an offence. We see it very often in many cities in our country.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8922203">Repeat offenders simply walk free. They do not have any consequences. As I said, it just encourages them to keep doing what they are doing. It encourages gangs to keep recruiting new members, and it does not stop new members of gangs from committing crimes. That is why we want to bring back jail, not bail. We want to make sure that, particularly for repeat offenders, there are consequences to those crimes and that the offenders actually do spend some time in jail to slow the process of crime that is happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922204">I just want to mention that we often hear the term “bail reform” from the government. I want to talk about that for a minute. We have to go back to what actually happened. Bail reform happened about 10 years ago, when the Liberal government came in. It implemented bail reform, and these are things I just described. Now, all of a sudden, the Liberals have finally woken up and realized that this is not working. Canadians have been telling them that for years, and they are finally realizing it. Now the Liberals want to do so-called bail reform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922205">Really what the Liberals are doing is fixing the mess they made with bail reform in the first place. What we are doing now is not bail reform; it is correcting the system, taking it back to the way it was, to actually having consequences for people who are committing crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922206">Of course drugs fuel crime, and that is part of the problem at our border. As I mentioned, drugs are flowing across the border shockingly freely. This has caused a big drug problem in our country. We all see it in our cities. I see it in Saskatoon. I am sure other members see it in their own cities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922207">Part of that is from the permissive harm reduction regime that has been promoted by the government. In fact, from what I have seen, it creates a cycle of dependence. In many ways, it is best compared to a palliative care kind of approach to dealing with people who have addiction issues, and it is not working. Safe supply has resulted in more deaths and more crime. The number of people on the streets who are involved in illicit drug use and in crime is just going up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922208">Instead of encouraging drug use by providing free needles, free hard drugs and all the other government programs, Conservatives believe drug users need a recovery-based system of care. We need to be compassionate with these people. They need help. We need to move them forward on the continuum of care so that they can actually get out of the situation they are in, not just allow them to remain there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922209">We need to bring home safe streets, schools and communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922210">Just to sum up, we are talking about this today because of the failure of the Liberal government over the last 10 years. It is now trying to fix the mess it has created. It is trying to fix the broken immigration system, where we have backlogs that have exploded, where the focus on skilled workers has been lost, where the loopholes are wide open and where we have consultants, colleges and employers taking advantage of the system we have. There have been seven immigration ministers in 10 years. That is crazy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922211">The government is also trying to fix the chaos at the border. It has lost control of our borders. Illegal crossings are up, and enforcement is down. There are more shipments of stolen vehicles. Drugs and precursors to drugs are coming across the borders, and firearms are coming across the borders illegally. There is a surge of crime in our country, with violent crime and gang activity rising, and the soft-on-crime laws are allowing offenders to walk free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922212">We have a plan to fix immigration and to speed up processing for skilled workers. We want to secure the border by closing illegal crossings and restoring order to the border. We want to crack down on crime by reintroducing mandatory jail time, ending catch-and-release and backing our police to make sure that we keep our communities safe. That is our plan.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8922218">With respect to the Ukrainian situation and the people who were invited to Canada from Ukraine, this is, I think, the core message. Canada said to people from Ukraine, “Come here. We will give you a safe place to stay and options”, so they came. Now, the government is saying that it does not know what to do with them. It does not know what to do, and they are going to be here, in some cases, 50 years to get the paperwork through because it did not plan this properly. Even though it knew there were going to be 300,000 people, it did not actually think there were going to be 300,000 people. That is basically what the government is saying: It does not know what to do with people. They are here, and that is great.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922219">I think we need to be fair and compassionate with these people. We invited them to come to our country, yet the government has not made a pathway for them to process their paperwork. Now they are stuck in limbo for potentially 50 years.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8922225">Mr. Speaker, one of the problems I have seen over the years from the government is that, when there is a problem, the solution is to throw money at it. It will add $1 billion for this and $100 million for that. We hear this all the time, over and over again. If there is a problem, the solution is money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922226">Yes, we do need more money. To hire more border guards takes more money, this is true. I would be in support of doing what we need to get our security up to where it needs to be, but that has to also come with the ability to train and hire people. That is not just about money. There are other factors at play there.</ParaText>

We are hearing about the potential abuse of the asylum system by people who are on these visas. Their visas are expiring, and they are being counselled by unscrupulous immigration consultants to abuse the asylum system and make false asylum claims. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8922231">Mr. Speaker, my colleague is very right that there has been a big mess created with temporary residence. There are over three million temporary residents in our country right now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922232">The bill would absolutely not solve that problem. There are fundamental issues with the way the immigration system is being run in this country. There are fundamental errors that have been made by the government in not monitoring certain numbers, for example, the number of students who were permitted to come into our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922233">As a result, we have the problems that we all know about, including a lack of housing, difficulty in accessing health care and problems with jobs. Our youth unemployment rate is very high. These are all things that are connected together, and these are things that the government could have managed. It could have seen the implications and the consequences of the decisions it was making and worked together to mitigate some of those things. The government has not done that. As a result, we have this problem in our country today. No, this bill will not solve that problem.</ParaText>

I am hoping my hon. colleague from Saskatoon West would agree with me that it would be far preferable, given the complexity of immigration and refugee issues, if the bill were to be split apart and only the committee on immigration and refugees would study the sections about immigration and refugees, not the sections on the Coast Guard, the Oceans Act, trafficking drugs, and so on.

They want to see improvements. From a technical perspective, the member is probably correct that how we deal with it in the House should be done according to who knows what about which area, but ultimately, the government needs to propose solutions that actually fix the messes it created. </ParaText>

I also speak as the shadow minister of national defence to reflect the concerns of the defence community, including the brave women and men who serve in uniform. I want to speak about some of the changes taking place because of the Liberals, as well as the lack of interest and investment in the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8922247">I want to give a big shout-out to the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="317911" Type="2">Kamloops—Thompson—Nicola</Affiliation>, the shadow minister of public safety; the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="317693" Type="2">Calgary Nose Hill</Affiliation>, our shadow minister of immigration; and the member for <Affiliation DbId="317724" Type="2">Saskatoon West</Affiliation>, who just spoke. They have really put a lot of work into Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> on the immigration side, on public safety issues and on border security.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922248">It is through their good work and the amount of exposure we, as Conservatives, have been able to give that we were able to mobilize citizens and civil society on Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> and look at all the violations of civil liberties being done by the Liberals. That bill was a big power grab that would erode charter rights, including the search and seizure to be done by Canada Post employees and the invasion of privacy rights online, through telecoms and banking changes. They would all violate the civil liberties of Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922249">The Privacy Commissioner himself said that he was never consulted by the Liberals on the drafting of Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> and had a number of concerns about it. We should never bring forward bills that erode the civil liberties of law-abiding Canadians, and that is what the Liberals continue to do time and time again. They go after people, like law-abiding firearms owners, rather than going after the gun smugglers and those using guns in illicit crime. They always do the easy thing and make it sound like they are doing something, but at the end of the day, all they are doing is targeting law-abiding Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922250">On Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, as Conservatives, we will do our homework. We will continue to look through this bill to make sure that Canadians' rights are protected, that the Liberals are not bringing forward any sneaky new laws trying to breach the rights of Canadians through this bill, especially civil liberties and privacy rights. We are concerned that there are things in here that are not going to do anything to improve immigration, improve public safety or strengthen our borders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922251">There is nothing in the bill on bail reform. There is nothing in the bill to give the Canada Border Services Agency the ability to police the entire border, not just ports of entry. There is an increase in sentencing provisions for those who are either smuggling in guns or trafficking fentanyl, and for other crimes that are being committed by transnational organizations. With the Liberals, house arrest is still allowed for some of the most serious crimes and offences, including for those who have breached the border.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922252">I am going to spend the rest of my time talking about the Canadian Coast Guard, which is part 4 of the bill. We support the great people at the Canadian Coast Guard for the work they have been doing for a long time. We believe we should expand their national security and defence mandate. We do support the idea of bringing them in under national defence, but we want to make sure it is being done for the right reasons and that the Coast Guard is given the right tools to do the job that we are going to be asking of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922253">We are concerned that the Liberals are only doing this for creative accounting purposes to try to increase their spending to meet the NATO 2% target, which they have to do in the next five months. Here we are in the middle of October, and we still do not have a plan or a budget from the Liberals on how they are going to get to that level. The estimates that we have to date show we are going to spend somewhere around $44 billion on national defence. In reality, to hit the 2% target, the Liberals are going to have to spend $61 billion. Where is that money coming from? What are they going to spend that money on?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922254">We only have five months left, and we know that the Department of National Defence and Public Services and Procurement Canada have always had a hell of a time trying to spend money before the end of the year, and this money cannot just be shovelled out the door. There needs to be a plan on how that is done, and we do not think that is going to happen. That is why we will see some creative accounting through bringing the Coast Guard in under national defence. We are going to get some extra spending but not necessarily any new defence capabilities for Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8922255">We would like to see, on every Coast Guard vessel, new sensors and weapon systems, so not only could the personnel do the surveillance that would be asked of them under Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, but they could also defend themselves if need be. As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="318167" Type="2">Cowichan—Malahat—Langford</Affiliation> said earlier today, the only things that are currently on Coast Guard vessels that have any fire power are shotguns for personnel use to protect themselves in case they run up against any predators. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922256">Thinking about icebreaking ships in the Arctic and polar bears, they have a few shotguns with banger shells in them to scare off the polar bears. They have another rifle that shoots beanbags so that they can throw a rope and tether to another ship or come alongside another ship for those purposes. However, there is no actual capability to defend themselves if need be. As the bill says, we would give them some security patrol capabilities, or responsibilities without any new capability. That is something we are really concerned about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922257">I want to make sure that Canadians and the House understand that the Canadian Coast Guard to date has no interdiction or enforcement capabilities or mandate. Right now, if the Coast Guard vessel operators encounter somebody fishing illegally, they have to contact the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to bring on one of its enforcement officers to make the arrest and levy the fines. We know that if they encountered somebody in our waters who was smuggling guns or involved in human trafficking, they would have to bring on board RCMP officers to make the arrest. They do not have any of those available at sea.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922258">The current Coast Guard budget is about $2.4 billion to date. It has been able to include, in the defence allocation for NATO in the last fiscal year, only $560 million out of that $2.4-billion budget. Again, with a stroke of the pen, the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is trying to take money from the Coast Guard and move it under the Department of National Defence without actually meeting the NATO requirement. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922259">I will just read what the NATO requirement is. This is out of one of its fact sheets from June 2024, regarding the definition of NATO expenditures that has been in place since the 1950s. It states:</ParaText>

We used to have a country that was safe and secure, the envy of the world. It was a country that worked for Canadians, that protected Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922292"> The Liberals might say that they have a new government. I know they are heckling right now, but they might think that this is a brand new government. It is not. It has the same Liberal members of Parliament, the same cabinet ministers and the same failed Liberal policies. </ParaText>

                <B>Arpan Khanna:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know they are not happy with what I am saying, but their policies are what hurt Canadians every single day. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922295">Under the Liberals' watch, we have had the fastest-shrinking economy, in which Canadians are now lining up at food banks. Crime, chaos and drugs are running rampant right across our country. There is a record amount of crime. Drugs are now being sold on our streets. Our kids are losing their lives. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922296">Under their watch, in 10 years, 50,000 Canadians have lost their lives to drug overdoses, which is more than were lost in the Second World War. We have a homelessness crisis. Encampments are popping up in my riding in Oxford County and across our country from coast to coast to coast. Canadians are suffering from the Liberals' failed policies. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922297">We had one of the best immigration programs in the world. It was the envy of the world. We brought in the brightest and the best, people who could achieve their full potential, who filled major needs in our country and were able to raise their family. However, under the Liberals' watch, they broke that too. They broke our immigration system, and then they started hijacking our institutions. They started censoring Canadians. They started telling Canadians what they could do, where they could go, what they could say and what they could see. It became all about control.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922298">When the Liberals first brought in Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, they talked about public safety and immigration, but it was another attempt to attack Canadians' freedoms and privacy. The Liberals wanted to attack Canadians' way of life. It is because of the Conservatives, other parties and Canadians who raised their voices, who objected and said no to the Liberals' policies, that we have Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> in Parliament today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922299">I am a proud son of immigrants. My parents chose Canada in the early 1980s. They came for that Canadian dream. They worked hard and played by the rules. They were able to earn a decent living and raise a family under their watch. However, we do not have that system anymore. The Liberals have broken that system in almost all respects. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922300">Let us take a look at the asylum system. We have over 300,000 folks lined up to get asylum. Many cases are bogus and fake asylum claims. It is a system that is now full of fraud and abuse, with an average wait time of almost 44 months to be processed in our country. This all started because of the Liberals' actions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922301">Members might remember that it was the government that put out a famous tweet when Trump was voted in the first time, which said that everybody is welcome. Can members guess what happened? </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8922303">Mr. Speaker, they think that is the best tweet ever. However, that tweet brought in over 100,000 illegal border crossers to Roxham Road. It put pressure on our system. Many of those cases were bogus, but we cannot fix stupid. That was a dumb move by the government and a dumb move by the former prime minister. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922304">The Liberals are making policy based on tweets. That is how they run the government. Their failures have led to the trouble we are seeing today. I find it ironic when the Liberals put policy forward saying that they are going to fix the system, that it is a new government, but it is their own doing. They did this. They broke it. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8922305">This is going to continue, sadly. We have seen it at the border as well, the Canada-U.S. border, one of the longest borders, an important hub for economics and security. Some $2 billion in trade crosses the border every single day. We have a massive economic opportunity. Most Canadians live 100 kilometres away from the border, so it is an important transportational and logistical hub for us, and we need a system that works for both Canada and the U.S. We can have strong economic ties. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922306">On security, it is even more important to keep Canadians safe. Under the Liberals' watch, we have had record numbers of crime, some of the highest. Gun crime and homicides have gone up. If we look at the border, we have seen a massive rise in guns being smuggled in. While the Liberals might believe that lawful, law-abiding firearms owners are the problem, they are not. I have been a firearms owner for over 15 years. I love going to the range. I am a sport shooter. Folks like me, farmers and hunters are not the problem. The problem is the Liberals' weak, open-border policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922307">Toronto police and law enforcement across our country have made it clear that 90% of the guns that come into our country are illegal guns. Criminals are not using guns from lawful gun owners. They are smuggling them in through the border. Those guns are now in our communities. They are being used for organized crime. They are being used to kill children. If we cannot secure the border and stop that from happening, we are going to keep losing Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922308">We now have cartels operating in our country, seven, under the Liberals' watch, under their soft-on-crime and open border policies. They have failed to secure our border. We have seven cartels that are illegally moving around drugs, laundering money and pushing guns, yet the Liberals have the audacity to stand up in the House and say they are going to fix the problem. They are the problem. It is them and their failed policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922309">It continues. Drugs keep being pushed in. Oxford County is on the 401 and 403, and it has become, sadly, a hub for drugs being brought into our community. I was talking with a family member who lost a loved one, a son, because he got addicted to drugs, illegal drugs that were brought into our community through the 401 and 403 corridors. They have had real-life consequences because of the Liberals' failures.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922310">Human trafficking is another huge part of the crime we are seeing in southwestern Ontario. Again, the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> responsible for public safety just puts his hands up and says that he is not going to enforce anything at the border. He was asked about hiring more CBSA officers. He said it was not his job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922311">We know what the Liberals do. They keep over-promising. They keep recycling the same photo ops. They keep announcing that they are going to hire new personnel, but when the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> was asked how many he had hired so far, the answer was zero. They have not hired any frontline officers. When asked when he would do it and why he had not done it, he put his hands up and said that it was not his responsibility. Well, whose responsibility is it? He is the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> responsible. He owes it to every single Canadian to do his job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922312">Sadly, it is the Liberals who have broken our system. Canada's Conservatives will always stand for law-abiding Canadians. We will invest in securing our borders. We will ensure that repeat violent offenders who commit crimes are locked up and put behind bars, and we will make sure that we fix the broken immigration system so that all Canadians can achieve their full potential.</ParaText>

The Liberal government, in 2019, was the first government ever to put scanners in place at our mailing and courier facilities. This has resulted in many weapons and drugs being seized that were coming into our country through the postal centre I went to. What our government did there was done at many ports as well, and we will continue to invest. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922331">I am so happy to stand today to talk about Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, because this bill would strengthen Canada's immigration system and borders act. It is a crucial piece of legislation that would address the evolving and complex challenges of crime that our country faces. This bill is about protecting Canadians, securing our borders and equipping our law enforcement agencies with the modern tools they need to combat sophisticated criminal networks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922332">As hon. members will recall, this bill builds upon Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> and has been introduced so that we can accelerate key legislative changes. These changes are focused on four primary areas that would significantly bolster our fight against crime. Under Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document>, we would secure our borders against illicit goods, combat transnational organized crime, disrupt illicit financing and enhance information sharing between law enforcement agencies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922333">Our borders are the first line of defence against illegal goods and criminal activity. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> introduces key amendments to the Customs Act that would modernize our border security framework. Under these amendments, the Canada Border Services Agency officers would be given new authority to access warehouses and transportation hubs to inspect goods that are being exported. This would close a critical gap in our enforcement and would prevent criminals from using Canada as a launching point for their illegal activities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922334">The Customs Act would be amended in order to obligate transporters and warehouse operators to provide access to their premises to allow for export inspections by CBSA officers. Furthermore, amendments would require owners and operators of certain ports of entry to provide facilities for export inspections, just as they currently do for imports. These changes would strengthen the CBSA's ability to detect and seize contraband for export, including illicit goods such as fentanyl and stolen vehicles. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922335">The bill would also further expand our maritime security. The Oceans Act would be amended to allow the Canadian Coast Guard to conduct security patrols and intelligence operations. This would strengthen our sovereignty and surveillance capabilities, particularly in remote regions like the Arctic, to better detect threats to our country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922336">Finally, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would further our efforts to tackle auto theft by targeting vulnerabilities in the export process. This bill would help curb the flow of stolen Canadian vehicles out of our country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8922338">International organized crime networks pose one of the most significant threats to public safety in Canada. Bill C-12 directly targets these groups in several ways. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922339">First, it aims to stop the flow of fentanyl. The bill would amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to accelerate the scheduling of precursor chemicals. This would give the Minister of Health the power to rapidly control chemicals used to produce illicit drugs, allowing law enforcement and border agencies to act swiftly and shut down illegal manufacturing.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8922340">Second, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> includes measures that would disrupt illicit financing and money laundering. It would increase maximum penalties for violations of Canada's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regime. Money laundering supports and perpetuates criminal activity by allowing criminals, such as fentanyl traffickers, to benefit from their illicit activities. Strong and effective anti-money laundering controls are, therefore, a critical component of a secure Canada-U.S. border. This bill proposes a comprehensive set of amendments to help ensure businesses and professionals are effective in detecting and deterring the money laundering and organized criminal networks that support and perpetuate fentanyl trafficking and other economically motivated crimes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922341">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> also aims to improve the capacity of law enforcement to respond to complex criminal challenges. It would enhance the RCMP's ability to share information on registered sex offenders with domestic and international law enforcement partners. Currently, registered Canadian sex offenders are required to report any international travel 14 days prior to their departure. Once reported, the RCMP conducts a risk assessment and provides notification to the destination country that the individual is travelling to, when warranted. As currently written, the threshold for sharing this information is high. Adjusting the legislative threshold would enhance the RCMP's ability to share this information with key law enforcement or government partners, including the United States, to prevent or investigate crimes of a sexual nature. Addressing these issues would strengthen the RCMP's ability to protect public safety both within Canada and abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922342">We owe it to Canadians to do all that we can to keep them and their families safe. The government has taken and continues to take action, and we know this legislation would help us to further reduce crime. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is a proactive response to modern crime, providing border agents and police with the tools they need to disrupt criminal networks. By passing this legislation, we will be strengthening our borders and protecting our communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8922359">Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I would like to acknowledge that we are gathered on the traditional unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922360">I rise today to speak to how the legislative changes proposed in Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C‑12</Document> will continue to uphold our humanitarian tradition and due process, while focusing resources on those in need and improving confidence in our asylum system. Canadians expect a robust, efficient and responsive immigration system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922361">The changes we are proposing would strengthen and streamline Canada's asylum and immigration systems. They include new rules on which asylum seekers may be referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, or IRB, as well as on how claims are received, processed and adjudicated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922362">Under this act, the federal government will no longer refer the following claims to the IRB: claims made more than a year after a person first arrived after June 24, 2020, and claims made 14 days or more after a person enters Canada illegally between border crossings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922363">The changes are intended to help protect our system from a sudden influx of applications, as well as from people who want to use the asylum system to extend their stay in Canada when other mechanisms fail. Let us be clear: Canada's asylum system is not a shortcut. We do not want to use this bill to turn away people who have a well-founded fear for their safety if they were returned to their country of origin. In these cases, applications would be referred to the removal process, which includes the possibility of requesting a pre-removal risk assessment, also known as a PRRA.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922364">People can request a PRRA when they believe they have a well-founded fear of being returned to a situation where they would be exposed to persecution, torture or other serious harm, for example. This safeguard ensures that changes to our asylum system do not undermine our commitment to protecting the world's most vulnerable people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922365">The PRRA complies with Canada's obligations under international human rights and refugee conventions. It is a well-established mechanism that operates within a broader system today, offering individuals who are facing removal the opportunity to demonstrate that they would be at risk of persecution or harm if they were returned.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922366">A request for a risk assessment may reveal information, such as conditions in their country of origin or personal circumstances, that makes their return dangerous. These may include, for example, political and economic upheavals, armed conflicts, or a country's changing social dynamics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922367">Similarly, personal circumstances, such as visibility in activism or family dynamics, can increase the risk of harm if these people return to their country. Risk assessments ensure that these factors are thoroughly examined before a removal order is issued. They are carried out by trained officers who carefully assess the credibility and significance of the evidence presented. It is a rigorous process, based on a thorough understanding of risk and refugee law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922368">The importance of such a process cannot be overstated. Without it, we would lack an essential safety net and there would be a risk of irreversible harm to individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922369">Canada's pre-removal risk assessment process gives people a fair opportunity to present evidence while ensuring that each case is reviewed thoroughly. This process is supported by a large amount of detailed data on conditions in the country and by agents trained to assess risk with a high degree of expertise and sensitivity to individual circumstances. This approach highlights the importance of the pre-removal risk assessment process in maintaining Canada's strong tradition of refugee protection.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8922370">The PRRA process also prevents legislative changes to our asylum system from inadvertently exposing people to harm. It is a safety net that lets decision-makers modernize and strengthen various aspects of our immigration framework, knowing that a loophole exists.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922371">By simplifying initial asylum decisions, reducing backlogs and modernizing pathways to protection, the PRRA is an essential safeguard that gives us the confidence we need to innovate responsibly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922372">It is important to keep in mind that the PRRA is not a tool for delaying legal removals. Rather, it ensures that every individual is reviewed based on the most recent information and circumstances to take full account of any risks they face and to avoid putting anyone in danger. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922373">All of us here in the House and in the Senate have a duty to ensure that Canada's immigration and asylum system mirrors our values of compassion and fairness, while meeting the needs of a changing global context and addressing the pressures confronting Canadians today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922374">The pre-removal risk assessment process reflects this balance. It reassures Canadians that, while we are taking urgent and necessary steps to strengthen our immigration system, we are doing so without compromising our commitment to protecting human life and dignity.</ParaText>

However, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would ensure that Canada's systems stay strong, credible and compassionate, and protect both our humanitarian obligations and our national interests. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922392">The first set of reforms would modernize Canada's asylum system, making it faster, fairer and more transparent. Right now, multiple departments often handle the same files, duplicating work and creating backlogs. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would fix those issues by creating a single intake system for asylum claims, which means that we would have less red tape, faster decisions and no more confusion about who is responsible for what in getting through these systems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922393">Under the new system, only hearing-ready cases would go before the Immigration and Refugee Board, which means background checks and identity verification would be completed first. This would reduce unnecessary delays and ensure that decisions are based on full information for the people who are making those decisions. The bill would also provide the board authority to remove abandoned and incomplete claims. If someone stops responding or no longer wishes to pursue their case, officials could close the case and focus on those who truly need protection. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would repeal outdated measures, like designated country of origin regime, a policy that no longer reflects the realities of modern migration. Together, these changes would create a faster, more complete and efficient asylum system that would protect the integrity of the process and at the same time uphold Canada's humanitarian tradition. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922394">The bill would strengthen the integrity of our borders and make it clear that those who deliberately delay filing a claim or who try to reset the clock by re-entering Canada would not be able to bypass our laws. It would introduce new eligibility rules; for example, claims filed more than a year after arrival may be deemed ineligible, and those who cross irregularly between ports of entry or avoid the safe third country agreement would not be referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board. It would protect our asylum system from being overwhelmed and would allow Canada to focus resources on people who genuinely come here looking for protection. It is about protecting and compassion with order. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922395">We, as a country, will remain open to those who are most vulnerable. Our borders will remain open to those who are truly fleeing persecution around the world. That is who we have been and that is who we will continue to be, but we must do so in a way that keeps our borders more secure and processes very credible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922396">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would bring our immigration system into the modern age of data and technology. For too long, different departments and provinces have worked in silos, and information gaps have slowed down processing, creating unnecessary duplication and adding unnecessary costs. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would enable secure, modern information sharing across federal departments, provinces and territories and trusted partners with strong privacy safeguards built in. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8922397">This would mean that newcomers could access housing, health care and settlement programs much sooner. It would mean that law enforcement and border officials could better detect fraud and identity theft. It would also mean fewer delays for people waiting to build their lives here in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922398">All privacy protections would remain robust. The framework was reviewed by the Department of Justice and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. Every agreement will be written, every safeguard explicit and every disclosure accountable under the law.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922399">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would give the government tools to respond to major or unforeseen challenges, whether that means a humanitarian crisis, a surge in irregular migration or even a global emergency, as we have, in the past, experienced. It would allow immigration documents like visas, electronic travel authorizations and permits to be temporarily suspended or cancelled only when it is within the public interest, for example in cases of widespread fraud or security threats. This would not be an overreach; it is about remaining robust in protecting Canadians and remaining prepared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922400">We will ensure that Canada can act quickly and responsibly when a situation demands it. These powers would be exercised with transparency, oversight and respect for due process.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922401">We have to act now because the pressures are real. The world has seen record levels of displacement. In 2023 alone, more than 110 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide. Irregular migration has increased, and the systems we built 20 years ago were not designed for the scale or speed we are seeing today. If we do not modernize, we risk losing both control and compassion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922402">Canadians have an expectation of their government to manage immigration responsibly, and that is exactly what we are going to do. We are going to uphold fairness for newcomers and confidence for citizens, and we are sure that Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is going to accomplish exactly that. It would replace outdated frameworks with a smarter, more adaptive model, one that serves people and protects Canada's borders with integrity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922403">It is fair to say there are concerns about how these reforms would work in practice. Advocates have asked that we preserve strong pathways for people facing new risks after arrival. Those voices completely matter and we are listening. The committee review will be an important part of that process where we will listen, take up amendments and the advice we are hearing from experts and make sure this bill is ready and prepared to do exactly what the spirit behind it is.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922404">Let us be clear. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would not weaken Canada's tradition of protection. It would strengthen it by ensuring the system is credible, efficient and able to deliver on its promises. A broken system helps absolutely no one in Canada, not claimants, not Canadians and not those who need urgent protections. A strong system, however, serves everyone better. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922405">Immigration is not only a humanitarian issue in Canada; it is an economic one. Our economy has often depended on attracting skilled workers, entrepreneurs and families that contribute to our communities. However, when the system is backlogged, confidence drops and opportunities are lost along the way. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> would ensure that the immigration system continues to be a driver of growth for everyone involved, while at the same time protecting the integrity that makes Canada's approach the envy of the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922406">For employers, it means predictability. For newcomers, it means clarity. For Canadians, it means confidence that immigration remains both fair and beneficial. This is not just about processing applications or updating databases, but about modern governance and a government that learns, adapts and delivers for its people. Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> embodies that principle. It would make government work smarter, focusing resources on what matters most, removing duplication and strengthening our accountability. It reflects a new way of governing, one that combines compassion with discipline and policy with delivery.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8922407">To conclude, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is about making our system work better for people. It would make asylum claim processing faster and more efficient, it would strengthen coordination across all departments, it would improve the integrity of our borders and it would uphold what defines us as Canadians. I know that in this House, many colleagues came to this country to become Canadians and are able to serve the communities that have hosted them and given them a second chance at life because of our system and because Canadians trust our immigration system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922408"> How much better is it that we all work together in this House to strengthen the system that many of us, including me, are so proud of? It is a system that works and allows a child who was a refugee surviving a genocide to become a member of Parliament in this House. That is what we are talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922409">Canadians are good people. Canadians are compassionate people, and they want this system to work. The polarization around immigration is not beneficial for Canada. Canadians want us members of Parliament from all parties to work together to address issues when we see them, and I think this bill would do exactly that. It would uphold what defines us as Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922410">This is a thoughtful and forward-looking bill that would manage immigration in a way that supports our economy and protects those who seek safety here and, at the same time, in a way that upholds our values and who we are as a country. It is about building a system that Canadians can trust and newcomers can count on. I invite the many members of this House who I know have been beneficiaries of the system to stand up for it, to work together to fix it, to stop talking down Canadians and our institutions, and to believe in this country, which many of us have called home for many years.</ParaText>

Federal health care spending for asylum claimants has now ballooned to nearly half a billion dollars a year, covering vision care, home care and assistive devices, benefits that millions of hard-working Canadians are not even covered for. Meanwhile, hard-working and law-abiding families in Richmond Hill cannot find a family doctor and are waiting months for basic treatment.</ParaText>

While the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> claims that the legislation will make Canada safer, the bill ultimately falls short on delivering on those promises. In my community of Abbotsford—South Langley, a major border crossing and hot spot for illicit drugs and arms smuggling, this failure is very real with real consequences.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922446">I have stood in this chamber numerous times to raise concerns about extortion and the rising wave of gun violence that is occurring, terrorizing our neighbourhoods and communities. We are calling for stronger border security, yet the Liberals have turned a blind eye, ignoring the urgent need to secure our borders, toughen crime laws and prioritize the safety of victims over the interests of gun smugglers, gangsters and violent criminals. My community members should not have to live in fear wondering if they will be the next victim of a drive-by shooting, or worry that their children might be hit with a stray bullet while sleeping in their bedroom or playing at the park.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922447">Securing Canada's borders and being tough on crime means giving our citizens peace of mind that illegal firearms and harmful drugs are not flooding our streets. Why do the Liberals not understand these basic measures? The Liberals' track record says it all. They are not serious about securing our borders or keeping Canadians safe. According to Health Canada and the latest figures, there were a total of 49,000 opioid deaths reported between January 2016 and June 2024. Many were due to drug ingredients trafficked from China and Mexico.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922448">The Washington Post reported in December 2023 that fentanyl super labs in Canada are producing mass amounts of drugs as well. The super labs that police are finding in Canada differ because they are synthesizing the drug with chemicals sourced primarily from China. In Langley, British Columbia, in my own community, police recently uncovered a super lab containing enough fentanyl and materials to kill 95 million people. Langley authorities also reported on how this super lab was capable of producing multiple kilograms of fentanyl on a weekly basis, yet this bill still lacks mandatory prison sentences for fentanyl traffickers. This is just disgraceful.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922449">To make matters worse, with so many lives lost, the Liberals continue to push for safe consumption sites near schools. Conservatives urged the Liberals at the health committee to shut down fentanyl consumption sites located close to schools and children for their safety. However, the Liberals and the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="318692" Type="4">health minister</Affiliation> refused to rule out approving even more sites near schools and day cares, despite admitting these locations have become hot spots for rampant fentanyl use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922450">In my riding, the Liberals are planning to slap a safe consumption site right across the street from a school. I have spoken with many parents, such as the parents from the Abbotsford Traditional School and those in the PAC that is also responsible for the school. They are genuinely concerned for their children's safety. They want to know what is happening in our communities. It is troubling. I find myself asking, alongside them, the same question, as this is truly concerning for our communities and children. Is this the Canada our children should be brought up in?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922451">If that was not bad enough, the Liberals' own <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> admits he will not even do his job to keep Canada safe. He has stated that he is not responsible for hiring a thousand new CBSA agents. Why are Canadians paying him? His role is to protect Canadians by securing our borders, and right now, he is failing at that. We are not expecting him to do the job interviews himself, but we expect him to follow through, do his job and hire agents accordingly. The fact is that fewer than a hundred agents have been hired. This is simply unacceptable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8922452">To make matters worse, gun crime under the Liberal government has risen by 116% over the past nine years, and the Toronto Police Association reports that 85% of gun crimes involve illegal firearms trafficked from the United States, yet the Liberal government will still allow some of the worst criminals to receive house arrest. How exactly is this supposed to make Canadians feel safe?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922453">Canadian agencies have identified 350 organized crime rings inside our country, including 63 linked to international groups from China and Mexico. The Liberal government allowed multiple ISIS terrorists into Canada, including one who was caught desecrating a body abroad and who was later charged with planning attacks in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922454">In 2022, a senior Iranian official was banned from entering Canada due to human rights abuses and terrorism, yet several investigations into Iranian agents on Canadian soil remain open. We know the government has lost 600 foreign nationals with criminal records, and over 400 of those evading the government are convicted of serious criminality right here in Canada. The government has openly admitted it has lost track of how many people are living in Canada illegally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922455">In my own riding, a sergeant from the Abbotsford Police Department reported that in my community there have been 60 incidents involving border jumpers on just one road alone. It is obvious that in my community there is an urgent need for border security and that it remains insecure, yet this bill fails to adequately address these concerns and serves as nothing more than Liberal empty promises. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922456">Conservatives are focused on making sure we prioritize Canadians' safety. Conservatives forced the Liberals to retreat from Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>, which threatened Canadians' freedoms and privacy, as we believe wholeheartedly that law-abiding Canadians should never be made to pay for the government's failures on borders and immigration. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922457">We will continue to defend Canadians' privacy and demand that the Liberals become tough on crime, end their soft-on-crime sentencing for serious violent repeat offenders, put a stop to drug trafficking that kills a record number of Canadians, secure our porous borders that risk this country's very own fabric and put criminals behind bars where they belong.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922458">It is my duty to stand up for my constituents and to hold the government accountable. I will continue to fight for meaningful action to restore the safety every Canadian deserves. The <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> opposite may claim the border is secure, but it is easy to say that when the evidence and statistics my colleagues and I continue to raise are ignored.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8922472">Mr. Speaker, I rise again on behalf of the people of Similkameen—South Okanagan—West Kootenay to speak to Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12, </Document>, an act respecting certain measures relating to the security of Canada's borders and the integrity of the Canadian immigration system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922473">This bill is of critical importance to my constituents, especially those living in border communities along the B.C.-Washington State line. We have six crossings: Osoyoos, Midway, Rossland, Grand Forks, Cawston and Rock Creek. This is a very mountainous terrain and one of the longest sections of border between Canada and the United States.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922474">Our entire riding is on the front lines of serious challenges: cross-border crime, drug trafficking and illegal weapons smuggling. Crime rates in communities throughout the riding of Similkameen—South Okanagan—West Kootenay have soared in the past decade. Sadly, the federal government has been slow to respond. Conservatives have long pushed for concrete measures to strengthen border security and disrupt criminal networks. For years, the Trudeau Liberals chose to look the other way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922475">Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is an improvement, but only because Conservatives and Canadians pushed back against the original version, Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document>. I received so many emails about Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> from people who were extremely concerned about Liberal overreach again. As Conservatives, we have argued that this had much less to do with strong borders and, of course, much more to do with government overreach.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922476">Let us be clear. If the Liberals had passed Bill <Document DbId="13543613" Type="3">C-2</Document> unopposed, they would have granted themselves sweeping powers, including letting Canada Post open my private mail and other people's without a warrant, allowing warrantless access to Canadians' personal data, and forcing tech companies to re-engineer their platforms for easier government surveillance. Those proposals were not about protecting our borders. They were about infringing on law-abiding Canadians' privacy. That is a victory for Canadians and for democracy, but vigilance is still required.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922477">Let us examine the government's track record. Since 2015, there has been a 632% increase in U.S. border patrol encounters involving people illegally crossing from the U.S. into Canada, many of whom are linked to drug and firearms trafficking. In Canada, 350 organized crime groups have been identified, yet instead of targeting gangs and smugglers, the Liberals have spent millions harassing licensed, law-abiding firearms owners with arbitrary bans that do nothing to make our communities safer. Meanwhile, gun crime is up 116% and 85% of gun offences involve illegal firearms from the United States from that porous border for the last decade.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922478">Our border is dangerously understaffed. Mark Weber, national president of the Customs and Immigration Union, says the CBSA is short 2,000 frontline officers. As well, while the <Affiliation DbId="318630" Type="4">public safety minister</Affiliation> keeps reannouncing plans to hire 1,000 agents, when asked why none have been hired yet, he said that he was not responsible for hiring. If he is not responsible for hiring, who is? What is the point of a minister who cannot deliver on his own promises? Even if hiring were to begin today, the CBSA is treading water.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922479">Thanks to sharp questioning from my colleague, the member for<Affiliation DbId="317814" Type="2"> Oshawa</Affiliation>, we learned from Mr. Weber that the agency trains just 600 officers per year, exactly the same as the attrition rate, when one does the math. In Mr. Weber's words, “I don't know how we're going to get our numbers up”.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8922480">What about hiring 1,000 RCMP officers? The border communities in my riding do not have enough RCMP officers, due to a lack of people applying at Depot. How is the government planning on bringing 1,000 more, when we cannot even address the needs we currently have?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922481">If the government truly wants to support border enforcement, here is one easy step: Please renew the lease of the Penticton Shooting Sports Association, which is in my riding. This facility has 400 members and has provided firearms training for law enforcement for 40 years. It is often the only option in southern British Columbia. The RCMP wrote a public letter supporting the club, and the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="318231" Type="2">Kelowna</Affiliation> recently called in a public letter for its lease to be renewed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922482">The lease expires in a matter of months. We are asking the Liberal government to find a way for this 40-year-old club to survive. This can be a bipartisan, common-sense decision. Do not shut down critical RCMP, CBSA and prison guard training infrastructure. Support this very important community club.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922483">Now I want to draw attention to a key section of the legislation, section 2, which would amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to give the Minister of Health a faster process to restrict precursor chemicals like deadly fentanyl. That is so overdue, but granting the power is not enough. Will the <Affiliation DbId="318692" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> use it? Will she act quickly enough? People are dying on a daily basis in our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922484">Just this month, at the health committee, I asked why the<Affiliation DbId="318692" Type="4"> health minister</Affiliation> will not revoke the Health Canada exemption that enabled a pilot program of hard-drug decriminalization in B.C. Premier Eby has now called the policy a mistake, and a <Affiliation DbId="317771" Type="2">Liberal MP</Affiliation> recently admitted that “it was a terrible policy decision.” The exemption clearly states that the minister can end the program at any time. When asked why she has not, she deflected, suggesting that B.C. must request it. Let me be clear: British Columbians want it ended immediately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922485">A member from across the aisle just told a story about an envelope full of fentanyl that was distributed throughout her community, and said to think of all of the people who were hurt by it because Canada Post could not open the envelope. I want to know how many MPs in this room would like to join the pilot program and have fentanyl decriminalized in their hometown. The experiment has gone horribly wrong. It has increased drug availability and public disorder while failing to connect addicts with real treatment. Why do members think no other provinces have joined the program?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922486"> The <Affiliation DbId="318692" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> should act today and end the program immediately.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922487">In closing, Bill <Document DbId="13632609" Type="3">C-12</Document> is a major improvement over its original form, but only because Conservatives held the government to account. There is more work to do, and we will continue to push for common-sense changes, such as strengthening our borders, protecting civil liberties, targeting real criminal threats and giving our border communities the tools they need to stay safe.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8922489">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise in Adjournment Proceedings this evening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922490">I am pursuing a question that I initially asked on September 26, not that long ago. I raised in the House in question period a really extraordinary experience I had earlier in the week while meeting with very brave Guatemalan indigenous women who had come to Canada to ask for our help in dealing with a Canadian mining company.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922491">It is not an unfamiliar story. We know that Canadian mining companies have, unfortunately, a record. It is not all of them; it is not a broad brush, but certainly Canadian mining companies have been associated in the global south with human rights abuses and abuse of the environment. In response to this, over the years, many people, particularly the former member of Parliament for Guildwood, the Hon. John McKay, have worked really hard to try to get legislation through to hold mining companies to account. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922492">In any case, when I met with the women from the Xinka community of Guatemala, I raised their issues here in the House and asked if there was at that point any action on something that was created some time ago in response to the pressure coming from many sides, including from civil society and, as I said, from people within the House of Commons, with legislation that almost passed at different times. Something was created with some fanfare: the Canadian ombudsperson for responsible enterprise. The current position of the ombudsperson is vacant, and I asked at the time, in question period, whether there would be a person appointed to this position.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922493">There has been a lot of criticism, ever since it was created after all this effort, that the ombudsperson really has no useful tools to investigate complaints. The idea was that if Canadian activity of different kinds by Canadian corporations was occurring in places around the world where we were complicit in human rights violations and environmental damage, there would be a way for Canada to intervene to improve the situation and put pressure on Canadian corporations to do the right thing. In any case, we never gave the Office of the Canadian ombudsperson for responsible enterprise any tools to do the job. Now there is no one in that position to do the job.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922494"> We now have something called the national contact point, which is somewhat lacking and is not very descriptive. However, we now know that there is a Canadian national contact point for people to make complaints about the failure of Canadian enterprises to follow responsible, sustainable business practices or respect international norms to protect human rights.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922495">The Xinka people who came to Canada complained that the Canadian silver mine Escobal, in Guatemala, was violating their rights. Where do they go with these complaints? The World Bank created an inspection panel many decades ago to hold to account those who took funds, investments and loans from the World Bank so that there was a way to track whether these dollars were being used responsibly and whether human rights were being respected.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922496">I want to ask the hon. member questions that I initially put to the <Affiliation DbId="318660" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>. Where are we on these multiple challenges? When will the government appoint a new Canadian ombudsperson for responsible enterprise, and will the office be funded?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8922497">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for her dedication and engagement on this important issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922498">The Government of Canada remains firmly committed to promoting responsible business conduct by Canadian companies operating abroad. Strong RBC practices not only drive business success, but also foster a better world for everyone, and Canada has been a strong global leader in that space for decades now.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922499">Since the launch of the CORE in 2019, Canada has significantly strengthened its responsible business conduct policy framework. We introduced a ban on the importation of goods produced with forced labour under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement. We also passed the Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act, transparency legislation that requires Canadian businesses to report annually on their efforts to prevent forced labour and child labour in their supply chains.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922500">Through the responsible business conduct abroad strategy, Canada provides clear guidance to companies operating internationally. A key pillar of this strategy is the support offered by Canada's trade commissioner service, a network of over 1,500 dedicated trade commissioners working from offices across Canada and at diplomatic missions around the world. Those are my former colleagues. I worked very closely with them, and I know how dedicated they are to this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922501">This strategy balances prevention, regulation and dispute resolution. It includes advisory services for Canadian companies; legislation targeting corruption, transparency and forced labour; and access to effective dispute resolution, not only through the CORE, but also through Canada's national contact point for responsible business conduct.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922502"> Established as part of Canada's membership to the OECD, our national contact point is a top-tier dispute resolution mechanism that promotes the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises and helps mediate concerns related to Canadian companies abroad. Canada actively participates in the global network of 51 national contact points, sharing best practices and strengthening our collective approach to responsible business conduct.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922503"> We play a leadership role in this multilateral space, with the OECD serving as a vital platform for member countries to explore and implement new responsible business conduct initiatives in response to an evolving global landscape. All of these measures are designed to enhance transparency and responsible business practices that prioritize the rights and well-being of workers and communities impacted by Canadian companies abroad, while helping companies manage risks effectively.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922504"> In light of these developments and the shifting global context, the government is considering how all parts of Canada's RBC framework, including the CORE and the national contact point, work together. We are also closely monitoring international trends to ensure Canada's approach remains effective, relevant and aligned with our global commitments and peers. Looking ahead, Canada is committed to advancing our RBC policies, deepening their application across diverse industries, harnessing innovation and driving meaningful change through global partnerships.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8922512">Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege to rise on behalf of the people of Elgin—St. Thomas—London South to ask the government once again to address a critical issue facing communities not just in my riding but across the country, which is the rampant lawlessness that exists on streets across this wonderful nation. Specifically, we are talking about drugs and people who are responsible for unleashing vast quantities of lethal, toxic drugs, yet still find themselves able to partake in the revolving-door bail system the Liberal government has allowed to blossom over the last 10 years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922513">Just to set the scene, I want to give a couple of very staggering statistics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922514">We know that fentanyl accounts for nearly two-thirds of opioid fatalities in Canada. We know that since 2015, there have been tens of thousands of opioid deaths, with a 255% increase since the Liberals took office. We know the Liberal government has rejected Conservative proposals to treat fentanyl kingpins as the mass murderers they are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922515">When I first rose to ask this question of the <Affiliation DbId="318625" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation>, the public health officials in my riding had released an advisory saying that carfentanil, a substance multiple times more fatal than fentanyl, was being found by authorities with greater frequency in the community of St. Thomas and the surrounding areas. People are dying, and the people responsible are walking free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922516">We cannot look at this issue in isolation from the other crime and justice issues that have been allowed to fester under the Liberal government. I have no doubt that the <Affiliation DbId="318625" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> has sent a representative to address these questions with a prepared statement. No doubt the government will talk about the forthcoming bail legislation it has been promising for months. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922517">However, the more we learn about it, the more we learn that it does not deal with the root of the problem. It does not undo the principle of restraint that the Liberal government embedded in the Criminal Code in Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document>, which is a provision that law enforcement officials have told us has directly caused the early releases of repeat, often violent offenders and, yes, drug traffickers on bail. They have told us this, by the way, every week as we investigate this at the justice committee. This Criminal Code provision says that they must be released at the earliest opportunity and under the least onerous conditions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922518">There is no meaningful bail reform if the Liberal government does not commit to repealing the principle of restraint. That is the commitment that Canadians, who are looking at rampant criminality on their streets, deserve to hear from the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922519">The reason this is so important is that crime has victims. Even non-violent crime, property crime, is a menace to communities. Businesses are dealing with the consequences of people addicted to drugs; those people absolutely deserve treatment and support, but this cannot come at the expense of looking at public safety as the first priority.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922520">Therefore, my question for the government is this: Will it, once and for all, put public safety first and repeal the principle of restraint to fix Liberal bail?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8922521">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to address the concerns about public safety in our justice system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922522">Canadians expect the government to act decisively to keep communities safe, and that is exactly what the Liberal government is doing. After a productive summer and after working closely with provinces, territories and frontline law enforcement, the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced last week that our government will be introducing new bail and sentencing reform legislation this week.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922523">The bill would aim to end conditional sentences for sexual assault offenders and introduce a tough reverse-onus bail provision for major violent crimes. This means that repeat violent offenders would now have to prove in court why they are not a risk to public safety and are worthy of obtaining a release, rather than have the Crown prove the contrary. The bill would also provide consecutive sentences for multiple offences committed by repeat offenders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922524">Canadians can count on us. We are delivering on our commitments by taking strong actions to keep violent and repeat offenders off our streets. Our government is assuming a responsible leadership, one where it listens to law enforcement, victims, survivors and provinces before drafting laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922525">While our government is working in collaboration with police, prosecutors, survivors and families of victims to develop serious bail reforms, what is the <Affiliation DbId="322132" Type="9">Conservative leader</Affiliation> doing? He attacks our brave men and women who put their lives at risk to protect them and all Canadians. Last week, the Conservative leader called the RCMP “despicable” and accused it of covering up supposed crimes committed by a former prime minister. That is dangerous and puts in question our rule of law. Even a top aide to Stephen Harper called the attacks made by the Conservative leader reckless and “Trumpian”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922526">It is time for the Conservatives to take bail reform seriously and rise above the politics of division. Instead of smearing institutions that keep Canadians safe, the Conservatives should join us in strengthening them. Conservatives like to talk tough on crime, but their record tells a different story. Let me remind the House that when they were in power, they introduced more than half a dozen crime bills, and every single one of them has been struck down by the Supreme Court of Canada. The most recent, the Hills decision in 2023 made it clear that their approach was not only unconstitutional but ineffective. In April, Canadians clearly rejected the failed Conservative divisive agenda at the ballot box, and they continue to do so today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922527">Our reforms are tough but fair, rooted in evidence and developed in collaboration with the provinces and territories, which are responsible for the administration of justice. We are not chasing headlines; we are building a safer, stronger Canada grounded in the rule of law. The new government is laser-focused on keeping Canadians, from coast to coast to coast, safe.</ParaText>

I have only a minute, so I will say that the law enforcement officials whom the <Affiliation DbId="319414" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> claims to be respecting are the ones who have been sounding the alarm about what the last 10 years of Liberal policy have done to handcuff them and prevent them from doing their jobs as effectively as they want.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922529">The greatest respect in the House for law enforcement comes from Conservatives, who have been calling members of law enforcement across the country to the justice committee.

              <ParaText id="8922534">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to address some of the questions I had about a month ago regarding housing starts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922535">I watched a very interesting interview with the <Affiliation DbId="318661" Type="4">housing minister</Affiliation> on one of our local political panels, which I think was this past weekend. He was asked a question about why he would not take the GST off all homebuilding. He stuttered and stammered and said the Liberals did not want to make big changes and that was a really big change. He said they were going to nibble around the edges. However, this party ran a campaign on building faster than the speed of light, building faster than anyone has ever seen houses being built.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922536"> I went back to Statistics Canada, and I saw that in July, housing starts rose by 3%, and in August they dropped by 16%. The member across is shaking her head, but I can read it. It said that housing starts dropped sharply in August, with housing starts in Canada declining 16% in August 2025. I know the Liberals are not big on numbers and factual information, but that is what Statistics Canada said. It also said housing starts went up by 14% in September. If they go up 3%, down 16% and up 14%, that is not as fast as anyone has ever seen housing being built.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922537">The <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> talks about big, major projects and getting stuff built, but his <Affiliation DbId="318661" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> is very concerned about moving too quickly on certain policies. I know imitation is the finest form of flattery, but the Liberals stole some of our campaign ideas, like taking the GST off houses costing $1.3 million and below. That is a good policy. As our leader has said, we are happy if they steal our good ideas. We want to make Canada a better place for Canadians to live. The Liberals can take all the good ideas they want from our platform.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922538">How does the parliamentary secretary to the housing minister reconcile her minister's inability to move quickly with the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s desire to get things built faster than they have ever been built? Those two things do not go together.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922539">Another thing I would ask is, how does the parliamentary secretary have faith in her housing minister, who, as the former mayor of Vancouver, left Vancouver, one of the highest-priced housing markets in North America, possibly in the world, in a dumpster fire? Why would he do any better for Canadians?</ParaText>

We have put forward the most ambitious housing plan in our country's history, and we are creating positive change in Canada's housing system. I would like to remind my colleague that the last time the Conservatives were in power, they lost 800,000 affordable homes and built six.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922542">We are building on our successes, making historic investments in new housing and working to lower housing costs for Canadians. As the member opposite should know, we just launched Build Canada Homes, a new agency to speed up the construction of housing at a pace not seen in generations, with a focus on affordable homes across the full continuum of affordability. To restore affordability and meet the demands of a growing Canada, we need a drastic increase in housing supply of all types. Through Build Canada Homes, we are building new homes to drive up supply and bring housing costs down.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922543">We are also taking action to help first-time homebuyers, with such measures as the tax-free first home savings account and the homebuyers' plan to help Canadians save for their first home. In addition, we are eliminating the GST for first-time homebuyers on new homes at or under $1 million and reducing the GST on new homes up to $1.5 million. We expect the Conservatives to get on board with this and help provide nearly $4 billion in tax cuts to first-time buyers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922544">Together with our partners in the private and non-profit sectors, indigenous communities and municipal, territorial and provincial levels of government, we are removing the barriers to new home construction and increasing the supply of affordable housing. Through targeted investments and financial measures, we are helping to restore affordability for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8922545">We need to build more homes, and we need to build them faster. One of the programs we have used to do this is the housing accelerator fund, which is removing barriers to housing development. We have signed agreements with more than 200 communities across the country to cut red tape and streamline the development process. We are also making significant investments in affordable housing through such programs as the affordable housing fund. As of June 30, over 50,000 new units have been committed through the affordable housing fund, and more than 30,000 of those units are under 80% of the median market rent, with rents expected to average $717 a month. Another 175,000 units have been repaired or renewed through this fund, with 135,000 of those units falling under 80% of median market rent. </ParaText>
