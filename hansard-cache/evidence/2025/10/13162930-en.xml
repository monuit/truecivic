              <ParaText id="8926000">Echoing my comments from last Thursday, I believe that both Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> and our particular study that we've agreed to—and we've heard several witnesses over the course of several days—are equally important. I believe that we can accomplish both studies at the same time. There is a pressing and ongoing need to have this discussion regarding sentencing and bail reform. It would be our preference, at least on the Conservative team, to continue doing that on a week-to-week basis.</ParaText>

We can cut some of the witness testimony short, but since they're here and ready to go, I'm confident that we can dispense with this at the end of proceedings if we reserve five to 10 minutes to do so.</ParaText>

We did not vote to adjourn debate on that motion. We did not reach a consensus on that. If, in the interest of expediency, there is a desire to dispense with the motion, I'm sure all of us can unanimously agree to adopt that motion and move on. I don't want to get us into a situation where we potentially end up with a party—not to single anyone out—deciding to filibuster the motion, which pertains to a meeting we're having in two days, without our having an opportunity to adopt that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926022">Respectfully, Chair, the motion is still live before this committee. If we do want to move on to witness testimony, which I am very eager to do, we can adopt the motion unanimously if my colleagues opposite agree.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8926043">Our organization represents nearly 2,000 criminal lawyers across Canada, many of whom are on the front lines of our courts, bail and sentencing courts in every province and every territory in Canada. Our members are also members of our communities. We live in the same communities where the victims of crime live, where police officers live and where everybody here lives. We want the exact same things in terms of public safety for our children that you want for yours, and we want to live in safe communities in dignity and harmony with our neighbours and to enjoy the rights and freedoms that we all enjoy as Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926044">Personally, I was called to the bar in 1993. I have spent much of my career dealing with issues in bail court, and I have litigated these issues in a number of provinces and at the Supreme Court of Canada. The issues of bail and bail delays have been persistent, and they have plagued our courts for about a quarter century, at least in my own experience as I've been dealing with them. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926045">I've provided some speaking notes, and there are some footnotes. I welcome everybody to review them. I'm not going to go into all those details. Our position from the CLA can be summarized in this way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926046">The bail system is not lenient, and the system cannot be perfect. It's important to recognize, contrary to many reports, that it is not easy to get bail in Canada. It is certainly not easy to get bail in a timely way, and it's not easy to get bail without facing unnecessary terms and conditions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926047">It's also important to recognize that having a successful bail system that maintains public confidence does not and cannot require perfect compliance. We must accept, as the Supreme Court of Canada has, that predicting future dangerousness is notoriously unreliable and will inevitably lead to unexpected and unfortunate negative outcomes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926048">The only way to remove all risk for those on bail is to eliminate bail, eliminate bail for all charges for all offenders. Of course, even if one ignores the constitutional barriers to that tongue-in-cheek suggestion, the criminogenic nature of our detention facilities would make that a net negative from a public safety standpoint if measured over a moderate period of time. Simply put, we cannot jail our way out of any public safety risk that will always accompany bail and sentencing decisions. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926049">Addressing the problem of repeat violent offenders was discussed when we were here last time to make some submissions on Bill <Document DbId="12426046" Type="3">C-48</Document>. That bill was designed to have “targeted changes” to the Criminal Code's bail regime to address “serious repeat violent offending with firearms, knives, bear spray and other weapons” and to address “the enhanced risks posed by intimate partner violence”. All of these were addressed through the primary mechanism of creating additional reverse-onus bail provisions at that time and were designed to apply to certain individuals and certain enumerated offences in certain circumstances. Today there is ongoing dialogue about adding additional reverse-onus provisions for the same general reasons. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926050">The position of the CLA is similar to the position taken by various other organizations that have appeared before this committee. Decisions to change bail legislation must be evidence-based and not the product of public sentiment that is stoked by individual cases or by partisan politics. Our submission is not based on the constitutionality of reverse-onus bail. It's simply based on our lived experience and the experience that we've seen in our courts. Reverse-onus bail does not lead to more detention orders. It leads to slower bail cases. It results in more cases being delayed in the bail courts and more people waiting for the bail cases to begin. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926051">In our submissions, in 2023, we predicted that this will lead to these types of delays, and that prediction has turned out to be 100% accurate, at least in Ontario. Further enactments of reverse-onus provisions or other barriers to bail will only exacerbate these problems. In other words, these barriers to bail will have a measurable and inverse effect on public safety, at least in the medium or long term. Remand centres, as I said, are highly criminogenic. Whatever short-term gains you realize from keeping a specific individual in custody without bail for that period of time will be outweighed by the increased risk to public safety from that same individual when he or she is eventually released. For every individual who loses a job, housing, a bed in a shelter or a spot in a treatment program simply from having their bail hearings delayed, even if bail is eventually granted, that individual will also contribute to an overall increased risk to public safety in our communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926052">We have three discrete suggestions—and I'll be quick about this, noting my time—that will assist in bail without addressing bail delays.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8926053"> First, in my respectful submission, Parliament can legislate a mandatory right to proceed with bail within 24 hours, if you're ready to go.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926054">Second, adjournments for matters that are “not reached” should be outlawed right in the Criminal Code. Bail adjournment should only be granted if requested by the prosecution for legitimate investigative reasons.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926055">Third, if those guarantees are not met, bail should be deemed not to be pursued by the Crown. Release should be granted, subject only to the mandatory conditions regarding weapons and protection of victims that exist in the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926056">I strongly urge the committee to consider some of these suggestions and to use this as an opportunity to address the real problems we have in our bail courts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926057">In my respectful submission, we can accomplish much more regarding public safety by adopting those measures than by some of the ones that are being publicly discussed.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8926061"> Thank you, Chair and members of the committee, for the invitation today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926062">I'm a criminal defence lawyer. I spend most of my time in court. I wish I could tell you that Canada's justice debates were guided by evidence, but they're not. Too often, they run on vibes and misinformation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926063">Lately, we've seen sweeping justice reforms proposed after a few high-profile cases, usually before the facts of those cases are fully known. That might be good politics, but it's bad policy-making.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926064">We all remember the Zameer case in Toronto. When Mr. Zameer was released on bail, politicians and police leaders declared the system broken. The jury heard the evidence and found him not guilty. That's the entire point: Presumption of innocence matters. Bail is how a free society honours that principle while protecting the public. When we legislate before we know the facts, we don't fix the problem. We create new problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926065">Let's talk about some facts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926066">First, bail's not easy to get. In Ottawa, my clients wait days and sometimes weeks just for a bail hearing. When there's serious violence and when there are breaches or weapons involved, police and Crowns rarely consent to the release. Bail courts take those cases very seriously. They look at the criminal record, the offence, the plan of supervision, the evidence and public safety. People are released, but calling this a catch-and-release system is a misrepresentation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926067">Second, even when release is granted, it's far more restrictive now than it used to be. Ontario has seen an expansion in the use of GPS monitoring, for example. Five years ago, it was exceptional; now, it's quite routine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926068">Third, we're detaining more people than ever. Our jails have never been fuller. About 80% of inmates in Ontario are in remand, awaiting a trial while presumed innocent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926069">Fourth, the conditions in remand are inhumane. Our courts have said so repeatedly. After an extensive review of prior cases, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice found the conditions at the Toronto South Detention Centre “fail to comport with basic standards of human decency.” Why? The court found that was “a deliberate policy choice to treat offenders in an inhumane fashion”. Just last month, the Ontario Court of Justice found things have gotten even worse. They haven't improved. It called the conditions “so appalling that it is hard to find words to adequately condemn them.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926070">My clients confirm what those judges have found. They are triple-bunked on the floor beside a toilet with no visits, no fresh air, endless lockdowns, no programs, no counselling and violence born of scarcity. If you were to design a system to increase reoffending, this would be it. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926071">That should matter to everyone. People don't emerge from these conditions better citizens. They come out cut off from family, treatment, school, work and housing. They are more traumatized, less stable and, yes, more likely to reoffend.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926072">On to some legislation and a myth we need to dispel. It's been a popular talking point to blame Bill <Document DbId="9745407" Type="3">C-75</Document> and the codification of the principle of restraint for the so-called bail crisis. That's wrong in fact and law. Bill C-75 simply codified what the Supreme Court has already said. Restraint and the ladder principle aren't just suggestions; they're constitutional guardrails.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926073">Let's be clear, proposals for mandatory detention or eliminating bail for certain offences run head-first into the Constitution. The Supreme Court has already struck down mandatory minimums for the same reason. They ignore the individualized, proportional analysis that the charter requires. They also don't work. Studies show this type of one-size-fits-all justice policy can actually increase the rate of reoffence. If the goal is safer communities, mandatory detention isn't the path. It's not the solution. It's just an illusion of one.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926074">No system is perfect, so what could actually help? Let's go through these quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926075">One, with real bail supports, give the courts options beyond jail. Expand supervised bail beds and provide culturally competent supports and third party monitoring.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926076">Two, with treatment on demand, fund in-patient and out-patient mental health and addiction treatment and tie that to bail and probation orders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926077">Three is smart compliance. Police budgets, have you noticed they always keep growing? How about we use some of that growth to actually do targeted checks on high-risk cases?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926078">Four, use the tools you already have. If a court gets a decision wrong—sometimes courts get things wrong—you appeal it. That's how you fix errors without ripping up the charter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926079">Five, fix the jails. Remand conditions are a public safety issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926080">Six, tell the truth. Wait for facts before rushing to a microphone.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8926081"> Those accused of serious violence are already the most likely to be detained and the law already reflects that.</ParaText>

We're always going to need to detain some people because risk can be real, but we should do it sparingly, lawfully and humanely. The presumption of innocence is not a loophole; it’s the backbone of a fair system. Restraint is not weakness—it’s discipline. Evidence, not vibes, should drive decisions that touch on liberty and public safety.</ParaText>

              <Affiliation DbId="294578" Type="28">Nicole Myers (Associate Professor, Department of Sociology, Queen’s University, As an Individual)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking>
            <Content>
              <ParaText id="8926086"> Thank you.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926087">I am a criminologist and an associate professor at Queen’s University. I have been studying issues around bail and pretrial detention for over 20 years, having observed hundreds of days of bail court, witnessed the decision-making process for thousands of people and interviewed justice professionals and accused individuals. It is from this position that I speak to you today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926088">When tragedies occur, it is easy to look to the law as the culprit and to think that with some adjustment, we can prevent further tragedies. We do this rather than the more complex task of addressing the root causes of crime that are supported by empirical evidence. The bail law is not responsible for these tragedies. The effectiveness of narrow rather than wholesale bail reform will be limited, as the problems with the bail system are not ones of leniency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926089">For the most part, bail is about making predictions, and predictions about humans are seldom 100% accurate. We only ever hear about the people charged with new offences. Nobody ever talks about the number of people who are released into the community, who show up as required and who do not commit offences. For every person who commits a serious offence, there are scores of others who do not. We are never going to be perfect at predicting the ones who will go on to commit an offence.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926090">The bail system is replete with problems. Keeping people in pretrial custody is not one of them. It is already difficult to get bail in this country. The issues with bail lean far heavier on the administration of the law rather than with the law itself. I caution you against proceeding with efforts that will make it easier to lock up legally innocent people when we are already quite good at doing so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926091">We can all agree that public safety is important. People should feel safe in their communities. The difference is in the views on how we get there. While tempting to be drawn in by catchy slogans, like “jail not bail” and “revolving door system”, these are not simply mis-characterizations; these are factually inaccurate. I encourage you to pursue empirically supported reforms rather than reforms that will make the problems with the bail system worse and increase rather than remediate risks to public safety.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926092">Let’s get some facts straight. Canada’s bail system is the harshest it has ever been. We have never before held this many legally innocent people in custody. The most recent data indicate that over 19,000 people were in remand on an average day and less than 6,000 people were serving a sentence in provincial custody. Across the country, 76% of the provincial jail population is in remand. The rate with which we hold people in remand has quadrupled in the last 40 years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926093">Another way to look at this is that 103,000 people were punished by being admitted to pretrial detention and less that 46,000 people were punished by being admitted to federal and provincial sentenced custody combined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926094">Internationally, we stand out amongst comparable nations as holding the highest proportion and rates of people in pretrial detention. As a free and democratic nation, this is not an enviable achievement. It is critical to strongly emphasize that it is indigenous peoples, Black and other racialized people, people experiencing poverty, as well as those who are struggling with mental health issues and substance use who are dramatically overrepresented. Said differently, it is the most marginalized in society who experience the most punitive aspects of our system. Any efforts to tighten the bail system will amplify these disproportionate impacts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926095">Being accused of a crime does not make it so. In 52% of cases in Canada, all charges against the accused person are withdrawn. That means only 46% of accused people are ever convicted of an offence. For those who are convicted and receive a custodial sentence, they are rightly given credit for their time in custody. The difficulty is that the sentence then appears artificially short, perpetuating inaccurate perceptions of leniency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926096">The current system has inverted the process, where the punishment commences upon arrest and accusation rather than conviction. We routinely punish people up front, prior to determining guilt. In doing so, we reduce any sentence that may be imposed post-conviction, reducing any available opportunities for rehabilitation. This says nothing of the heavy consequences for the hundreds of thousands of cases that conclude with all charges being withdrawn. For many people, pretrial custody is the punishment before, and often in the absence of, any conviction for wrongdoing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926097">Call me old-fashioned, but in my view, before we punish individuals, we ought to convict them of the offence first. It would be better to focus our attention on holding guilty people accountable rather than punishing legally innocent people for something they may or may not have done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926098">An accusation can send somebody's life sideways, disrupting the very community connections that provide stability and are known to protect against crime. We must be mindful that custody makes it more—not less—likely for people to engage in crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926099">Crime goes up and down for many reasons. Neither bail nor sentencing laws are one of them. Tightening the bail law will likely increase the number of legally innocent people in custody and do almost nothing to reduce crime or improve public safety. We cannot incarcerate crime away. If incarceration worked, the United States would be the safest country in the world.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926100">I encourage you to avoid legislating blanket requirements, such as automatically denying bail, creating mandatory minimum sentences or any three-strike policy. It is critical that discretion is maintained or you risk legislating unfairness and injustice. Indeed, research demonstrates that Canadians want something more akin to structured discretion or presumptive guidelines rather than mandatory minimums.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="8926101"> Resist falling for factually inaccurate assessments about the bail system. This, in so many ways, is about the administration of law, not the law itself. It is the provinces that are best positioned to implement measures to improve the system, not by building more jails but by focusing on efforts to improve the operation of the court system.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8926158">I mean, look, one thing we don't do well is talk to people who are victimized and are the victims of crime. I think the wrong way to respond is with statistics. I think it's wrong to say that we've never been safer, and that Individual A over here was released on bail for first-degree murder and then was found not guilty and was innocent. I think that is not a good way to respond. I think it's appropriate to respond with compassion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926159">I also think it is appropriate, when responding to those individual people and the community as a whole—I say this to all the parliamentarians—to make sure that we don't weaponize the criminal justice system as a political wedge issue, and to make sure that when we're talking about rates of offence, the purposes of the bail system, the risks and trade-offs and the balancing of rights, we do that accurately and not for political reasons. I think that goes a long way to helping people understand.</ParaText>

People might feel upset or that the criminal justice system is unjust, especially when looking at particular cases.

              <ParaText id="8926167">As all three of us have been saying today, our existing laws give us the necessary weapons to assess risk and detain those who pose a risk that is deemed to be too high to the community. That's what our trained and experienced judges and justices of the peace in Ontario and throughout Canada are trained to do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926168">We want to ensure that the people who deserve to be detained—in other words, those who pose an unmanageable risk—are in fact detained. Imposing artificial standards that won't reduce the risk and won't actually have any meaningful impact on protecting the public but are simply catchy or sound good, such as “jail, not bail”, won't take any steps forward in terms of ensuring that our system gets it right. What we need to do, as all of us have said, is to get rid of the low-hanging fruit, or the things that tie up our courts. Give our courts more time to deal with the serious cases. Rushed decisions are not good decisions. If we give our courts the weapons to deal with the serious cases, they're going to get it right as often as they can—and more often than they get it right right now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926169">No one is saying that dangerous people shouldn't be detained. We're simply saying that we detain too many others we don't need to detain in our hunt to try to cover off anybody potentially dangerous. We have way too much overreach when we try to do that. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8926172">Again, if we were to randomly select people from the street to act as judges for any given case, then we might want to have some guidelines that we legislatively set out that these untrained people would have to impose on any particular case, but we go through a rigorous process of selecting the best to be our judges. We have to trust that they will apply the law that's handed down from the Supreme Court of Canada and provincial appellate courts appropriately. It's their job to assess any particular case and apply the proportionate, proper sentence for every individual.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926173">It's an individualized process. When we go for medical treatment, we don't say that every person treated with cancer has to be treated with the exact same drugs in every single case. We individualize the treatment plans based on the person who's getting the treatment, and we should be doing the exact same thing when we're sentencing somebody for a particular crime.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8926179">One of the most important things we can look at is thinking about the ways we can support people in the community. What we want to be doing is thinking about, when folks are coming out, how we can best support them. What is it that they need to be able to continue to come back to court as required and to comply with all of the conditions?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926180">These are some of the things that were already spoken about by Michael Spratt's talking about bail verification and supervision programs or bail beds. These are the kinds of opportunities that can provide the support that folks might ultimately need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926181">The other critical thing that we really need to be doing is system minimization, finding alternative ways of holding people accountable for relatively minor things. It's not to say that we don't do anything, but to the extent that we can keep them out of bail court so we can really focus our time and resources on those things that are most risky or most dangerous will allow us to not only move people through the process in a timely manner but reserve detention for those for whom it is absolutely required.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8926186">Some things we may want to think about are what might be some of the hurdles or barriers we want to have in place before we admit someone to custody. If we're thinking about proportionality in the context of sentencing, where there's supposed to be some equation between the harm and moral blameworthiness in the sentence, at bail perhaps we ask, “If this individual were to be convicted, would they even get a custodial sentence?” We're holding a lot of people in custody, and they are very unlikely to receive a custodial sentence at all.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8926189">It's not just provincial court resources but the superior court. The idea that we have more bail hearings in the superior court is only going to tax a system that is already at its breaking point, a civil system that is falling apart under delay and a criminal system—we've heard about this for the last number of years—where serious cases are at risk of being thrown out of court because of a lack of judicial resources.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926190">Part of the problem with bills like that, despite catchy slogans, is that they don't look at the cost. When you detain more people in these conditions—inhumane, terrible conditions—there's a cost to that. One of the benefits might be that you prevent one person from reoffending, but when you detain thousands to do that, there is a downstream cost. That cost is steep given the conditions, given the resources and given the other drawbacks that we've all spoken about.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8926198">Let us talk about rehabilitation and how to solve the problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926199">I support the presumption of innocence. I think that the justice system, which aims to allow people to be free as long as they are not convicted, is good. I also agree with the idea that when the accused pose a risk to public safety, this must be taken into account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926200">In fact, the risk to public safety involves three conditions: the risk to public health, the risk of the accused not appearing at the next hearing date and the risk of bringing the administration of justice into disrepute. These are three problematic and troubling situations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926201">There is also the right of victims. My Conservative colleagues have often spoken about this, and rightly so. Not only must the public be protected, but the fears of victims and of society as a whole must also be taken into consideration. When a victim fears the release of their abuser, that victim is not the only one who is afraid. Many people close to the victim are afraid as well. Society as a whole is at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926202">How should the right of the accused to be free until found guilty be reconciled with the right of society and victims to be protected from harms that may seem foreseeable?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926203">There have been recent cases, including one in my riding. A man was found guilty of breaching his release conditions 16 times. While he was still at large, he killed his ex-partner.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926204">I am sure that all three of you would agree that this makes no sense. However, we do not know whether it is possible to protect ourselves against such a situation. My question is a long one, and I apologize for that.</ParaText>

When someone is arrested and they have a long history of violent offending, we can be pretty confident that they are a significant risk and that person will usually be detained. However, we don't know how to predict very well whether somebody arrested on a minor property offence and released will then go out and kill their spouse.

We cannot achieve 100%, and if we aim to do that and think we've failed otherwise, the system will not be seen by the public as working. Respectfully, we have to accept that there is an unquantifiable degree of risk that we cannot capture in any possible way. The test is a “substantial likelihood of reoffending”, and we do a pretty good job of putting those people behind bars. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926215">I have one final thought about your domestic violence case. There are thousands of individuals charged with domestic violence offences every day who do not kill their spouses before their trial, and they are rightly released on bail—but some of them will.

One of the things I hear most often from those people is that they want to make sure that when someone is released, there are conditions imposed that allow them to feel safe in the community.</ParaText>

This is cold comfort to someone who has been affected by crime, but as legislators who look not just at specific cases but at everything, I would commend you to look more broadly, because the answer—the cold answer—is showing sympathy for that crime but saying that if we detained everyone, it would be even worse.</ParaText>

Some people did adopt that strategy, and you could end up coming out a little bit further ahead. It is no longer a winning proposition. If you do the math, it doesn't work. You're actually better off getting bail and getting sentenced afterwards, not to mention the time spent will be much easier and in better conditions. If you're serving your sentence after sentencing, you'll do less time, typically, and you'll serve it in better conditions. Nobody who knows what they're doing should be adopting that strategy anymore.</ParaText>

It's not just Toronto South; it's throughout Ontario in many institutions and, frankly, throughout the country. It's a far greater problem than just Toronto South, but yes, in light of some of these conditions, some judges in some cases are awarding enhanced credit. That has happened, but I don't know a single defence lawyer who has ever adopted the strategy of keeping their client in custody longer so they can then argue for enhanced credit if their client is found guilty.

              <ParaText id="8926257">I think I'm on solid ground when I say that everybody in this room and everybody I know wants bad guys in jails and wants the system to function properly. The problem is that you take these individual cases and sensationalize them, and it blows up. Every time you turn on the news, people get the wrong impression. A number of times, I've seen, daily almost, some heinous crime happen in the city of Toronto, where I live, and some politician says, without even knowing who committed the crime, that the person was probably out on bail. The whole community thinks this has something to do with bail when it probably doesn't.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926258">I'm tempted to ask how we stop that, but it's an unfair question because unless you take it out of the hands of politicians, you can't.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926259">What we have to do is find a way to tone down the rhetoric, find a system that works and find a solution that creates an environment where everybody is confident that it works. What we're really talking about, in terms of the political side, is making sure that the general public has confidence in our system.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8926262">The nature of our litigation in bail courts, especially in Ontario, is that we cannot manage to complete our lists. Cases that are ready to proceed can't be reached because we have only so many hours in a day. In Toronto, we typically have 25 cases that are ready to proceed with bail. We typically get through 10 to 12 of them. The math doesn't add up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926263">Crowns need to consent to more reasonable releases. Fewer matters are being consented to than ever before. It's creating an untenable situation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926264">As I said, the problem isn't just that we detain too many people. Others have said that. I'm not so sure that I necessarily want to go down that road too far. It's that we wait too long to release the people who get released, and they end up losing jobs, houses, treatment and all sorts of things. The people who wait two weeks for their bail hearings may as well be detained because their lives are crushed. That's what causes further harm.</ParaText>

I've sat in court, and I've had lawyers who work with me sit in court, day after day, to reach the same bail hearing.

              <ParaText id="8926292">Protecting the presumption of innocence is critically important, but as has been said by all of us here, we do need to be thinking about victims, community safety and public safety. It is a balance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926293">We're left with the difficulty that we cannot perfectly predict. We're making imperfect predictions, but we want to do that as best we can. The best way we can possibly to do that is to get the minor stuff out of the bail system so that we can focus on that which is more serious and, when we are making decisions, to make them quickly.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926294"> Every single day in the bail court, the most common decision is an adjournment. We make very few bail decisions every day in court, whether that's a consent release or after a show cause hearing. Every day, that is the most common outcome. If we can reduce that and make that bail decision much sooner, we can avoid causing all the kinds of harm that come from that extra time in detention.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8926362">I remind everybody that today is October 7, a very significant day, and the piece of legislation we have before us would solve some of the issues that communities in each of our ridings, stakeholders in each of our ridings, have asked us to look at, to study and to come up with legislation on as soon as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926363">The way the motion is drafted, we are looking at 10 meetings, Mr. Chair. I'm of the opinion that we can easily have this disposed of in a matter of five meetings at most—or at best, however you want to qualify that. Should members stick to 10 meetings, which will obviously take up a lot of the committee's time—and I understand that the suggestion last time around was to study this concurrently—then I will suggest that we increase the number of meetings of this committee so that we can go ahead and expedite the study and this important piece of legislation.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8926374">When this committee established its priorities, I think we all agreed—and I'm very grateful that there was a general agreement across party lines—how pressing the concerns were that led to the studies that we championed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926375"> There's a reason that we decided to lead off with a study on bail, repeat offenders and sentencing. It was because stakeholders in my riding and across the country have been crying out for action on this file. We have heard from victims' groups. We have heard from law enforcement. We have heard from municipalities. We have heard from provinces about how urgently these issues need to be resolved.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926376"> I think the work we're doing on this particular study is incredibly important. We do know that Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> is before this committee as well, and I think Mr. Brock's motion to deal with these concurrently recognizes that both are important issues. No one is disagreeing with that. We also know that the Liberal government has promised other legislation that is also likely to go before this committee. We cannot have a situation in which the studies that we've all, as members, agreed to adopt get indefinitely punted down the road because of government legislation. I think it's incredibly important that we do both of these studies concurrently. I think the proposal to have one meeting each week dedicated to each of these priorities is incredibly reasonable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926377">As for the number of meetings, I don't have an exact number, but to Ms. Lattanzio's point, I have already had numerous requests to appear on Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, specifically from stakeholders with very active participation in this and from individuals representing a range of ethnic communities, religious communities and legal interests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926378">I do not want to shortchange a very important study that needs to take place on Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, and I think 10 meetings is very reasonable on that. I think it's more important to do it right than it is to rush something like this.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8926380">There is a relationship between the two. I think we'll be very serious in considering the number of meetings that we need to have. The House has asked us to consider it, and it is of extreme importance to the people who put us in those seats.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8926386">The Conservative members are of the view that Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> is fraught with a lot of issues and therefore requires considerable attention. Anything less than 10 meetings would not enable the various stakeholders.... As Ms. Lattanzio can imagine, there is a lot of interest in this bill, and not necessarily good interest given some of the concerns articulated in the definitions or the reduction of the threshold with respect to meeting the threshold of hatred. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926387">There are concerns with private prosecutions with respect to hate charges that could be instituted without the consent of the Attorney General. There is the application of a new stand-alone criminal offence on conduct that is prescribed by any other act of Parliament. We could have a civil statute, like a Canada Labour Code violation, potentially attracting a criminal charge. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926388">There is a lot to be concerned about with respect to what the Liberals are proposing in Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>. This requires that we give it fulsome consideration. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926389">At the same time, as a member of the Jewish community, I take considerable exception to Ms. Lattanzio's point that today being October 7 means that somehow this bill is going to address some of the issues that have arisen under this Liberal government since October 7. In fact, the vast majority of issues concerning the Jewish community today are already criminalized. Most of the behaviour that concerns us is already criminalized in the Criminal Code, yet unfortunately, because of the tone set by this government, it does not attract enforcement, whether it's the incitement to violence that we're hearing on the streets of Toronto and Montreal.... Today, at the University of Toronto, students are glorifying the martyrs. They're glorifying murder on the second anniversary of October 7. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926390">I take some exception to the suggestion that, with it being October 7, we need to do something or other. Definitely, we cannot have a situation where we don't give Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> a very serious look.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8926396">Mr. Lawton pointed out earlier with one of our witnesses on the first panel that her research didn't include speaking to victims. I think that he was alluding to that being a flaw in her approach. The next panel of witnesses we now have waiting for us includes the Victim Services of Brant, which would address some of those issues that he raised, yet here we are delaying dealing with Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926397">He also made the point of saying that he's had numerous requests for people to appear on Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> and that he doesn't want to disappoint them. He feels very strongly about this bill, as do they, which is why we need to proceed with Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>, and we shouldn't bifurcate the process and deal with the current study.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926398">Mr. Baber said that Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> is fraught with issues. Maybe it is. Maybe you're right. Let's get the witnesses in and hear them. That's what we're doing here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926399">The legislation is before the committee and, as the chair has quite rightly pointed out, committees are masters of their own domain. This bill has been referred to this committee, and it's been a standing practice of this place in the 10 years I've been here that legislation takes priority, so let's deal with it. Let's get those witnesses whom Mr. Lawton wants in here. Let's address those concerns that Mr. Baber has.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926400">Here's the other thing. We worked very well together, Mr. Lawton, a few weeks ago with Mr. Fortin and all of the people around this table, and we agreed on an approach, an agenda and a sequence of events for what we were going to do. We worked for very well together, I thought, merging all of these various motions, because we agree that bail reform and sentencing is an issue that we all feel strongly about and we need to address, but so is Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document>. If we do this the way you're talking about, Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> will not get back to the House until the new year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926401">We all know that bail reform legislation and sentencing legislation is coming. The <Affiliation DbId="318628" Type="96">minister</Affiliation> has been quite clear about that. The most logical way to proceed, based on this spirit of co-operation that we've shown so far, is to deal with Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> and get it done. We can sort out the number of meetings required to do that, whether it's four or nine, whatever that is. We can sort that out, and once that's done, we can get back to the study we're doing now, which might dovetail nicely with the legislation that's coming. It's certainly not going to be a setback, and it could be an advantage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926402">It seems to be completely illogical and inconsistent with the approach we've been taking to try to bifurcate this process right now. The only way to look at it is that it's an effort to delay so that no legislation gets back to the House. We have an obligation as a committee, whether you like it or not.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926403">We don't have a majority government, Mr. Baber, so we can't ram legislation through the committee or the House, so let's get here, let's call the witnesses you want, let's call the witnesses everybody around this table wants to hear from and let's deal with the legislation that Mr. Lawton has said is so important, because that's what we're here to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926404">We know that the <Affiliation DbId="318628" Type="96">minister</Affiliation> is scheduled to come on Thursday. Let's get it started and get moving, and we can get back to the other study maybe at the same time as we're studying the next piece of legislation, and that is highly efficient.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8926435">I want to thank Mr. Chang for his comments. It's another reason we should proceed with this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926436">It seems ludicrous to me that every single member sitting around this table has talked about how important Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> is, yet we're debating a motion to delay it. It's counterintuitive. Somebody will have to explain to me the rationale behind that if it's anything other than wanting to delay the legislation. You can't on the one hand say that it's important and that it's something we need to deal with because it's critical, and then say that you want to delay it. It doesn't make any sense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926437">Mr. Fortin, I agree with you completely: Your motion is in the hopper and it's waiting to be debated. If we adopt Mr. Brock's motion, your motion will be delayed further. If you game this out and you follow the sequence of events, if we get Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> done, we can then get back to the bail study, which will probably coincide with the bail legislation. That would allow both of those bills to get through this committee faster and more efficiently, and would allow us an opportunity to get to your study. If we adopt the approach Mr. Brock has outlined, we'll have two parallel tracks, which will delay both. We'll go down this road with the bail study, probably get the bail legislation and still be dealing with Bill C-9 because we'll be so logjammed in this committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926438">Mr. Fortin, you can be as optimistic as you want, sir, and hope that your study gets before this committee, but in that scenario, the likelihood of that happening diminishes rapidly. The only logical way to do this is to proceed in the fashion we agreed to earlier. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926439">Look, it's not like this was not anticipated. When we were talking about what studies we were going to do, we were talking about a scenario in which the <Affiliation DbId="318628" Type="96">justice minister</Affiliation> would appear to talk about his mandate or the timing of it could coincide with legislation. That's now what's happening on Thursday. If we proceed as we currently plan, with Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> first and then the bail study and bill when it comes, we could have that opportunity again and kill two birds with one stone, as opposed to the minister coming in.... I suspect he'll get questions about bail when he's here on Bill C-9 and we'll get into this duplicating process. We'll waste time and have more motions that are unproductive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926440">If we want to be efficient and get all these things accomplished, which everybody says they do, the only way to do it, sir, is to do Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> on its own, finish it and move back to the bail study, which will coincide with the legislation. Then we can get to your study. I'm not trying to delay your study. I want to get on with it too, but I can almost guarantee that it won't happen if we adopt Mr. Brock's motion, because it's a channel for further delay. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926441">Again, the irony is that it makes no sense. I would really like somebody on the other side to explain to me how they're so eager to deal with Bill <Document DbId="13590613" Type="3">C-9</Document> and so anxious to get all these witnesses here, yet they don't want to go ahead and study the legislation. It just doesn't make any sense. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926442">Mr. Fortin, I'm urging you to consider voting against Mr. Brock's motion, because it will assist you in achieving your goal. I agree with Mr. Brock that this motion has caused delay that's completely unnecessary.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926443"> I didn't realize that witness was yours, Mr. Brock. That's very unfortunate. You can apologize to them afterwards for this unnecessary waste of their time. </ParaText>

Canada has seen a rise in anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and other hate-motivated crimes targeting religious, cultural and community spaces. I would like to remind the committee that this bill aims to close the gaps in the Criminal Code by extending protections to these spaces, as with safeguards for health facilities. It also clarifies the definition of hatred, removes the need for the AG's consent on hate propaganda charges and helps law enforcement respond more consistently and quickly. At the same time, it preserves lawful protest and free expression while clearly distinguishing it from conduct that intimidates, obstructs or promotes hatred. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926448">Mr. Chair, there have been comments made around the table in terms of what this bill would do, and perhaps questions were raised. I would suggest to the members that the purpose of this bill, the first pillar of this bill, is proposing a new obstructive offence. This bill would create a new offence making it illegal to block or interfere with lawful access to places like religious institutions, cultural centres, schools, seniors residences or cemeteries primarily serving identifiable groups. It mirrors existing protections around health facilities and ensures that these protests that are peaceful expressions exist and that they can remain lawful. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8926471">The legislation will strengthen Canada's response to hate-motivated crime. It creates a new hate crime offence applying to any federal offence broken out of hatred. It introduces a new offence for publicly displaying hate or terrorist symbols to promote hatred. It codifies the legal meaning of “hatred” and removes the Attorney General's consent requirement for hate propaganda charges, making enforcement swifter and more consistent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926472"> Any federal offence would capture all offences in the Criminal Code or any other federal law, such as the Firearms Act. It would serve to broadly and explicitly denounce all criminal conduct motivated by hate: for example, vandalism of a cultural centre motivated by anti-religious hate or the public display of Nazi symbols or terrorist insignia to wilfully promote hatred.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8926473">Also, it would propose the codification of the definition of “hatred”. The bill clarifies what conduct is captured by the new hate crime offence, as well as the existing hate propaganda offences, and supports a more consistent use of these offences by law enforcement. Based on the Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence, the definition is also centred on the concept of vilification and detestation. It also specifies what is not hatred: namely, mere dislike or disdain or acts that merely offend or humiliate.
