              <ParaText id="8923399">Quickly, you have all received the copy of the procurement ombudsman's report on “bait and switch”—the review of replacement resources. It's embargoed until October 15. He's going to table it in the House, so it will be public that day. We agreed to have him come to the committee. I'm going to suggest we have October 21 open. We can have him in on our brief and then also address that report at the same time.</ParaText>

                <B>The Chair:</B> We had asked for witnesses for the Canada Post study, but it's being pushed back because of the labour issue. They also committed to turning in a report to the government within 45 days. I'm just letting everyone know that we will extend that, or we will seek witnesses at a much later date, once we can formalize dates for Canada Post to come back.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8923409">I don't know what you think, but as far as I'm concerned, this is a flood of individuals. There are 13 million addresses in Canada, and many people are worried and awaiting news.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8923410">Since we held a vote last week, I expected us to be able to inform people who are worried. I repeat my request that <Affiliation DbId="318684" Type="4">Minister Lightbound</Affiliation> appear before the committee and answer our questions. Might he be available Thursday? The problem is, we're won't be here next week. It's late to inform people who are worried.</ParaText>
