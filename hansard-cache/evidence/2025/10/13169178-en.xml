              <ParaText id="8938667">Mr. Chair, honourable members, thank you for inviting me today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938668">Having spoken with many of you over the last few months, I recognize the important work that you are all doing. I also recognize the important work you are doing as a committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938669">Access to care and internationally educated health professionals is one of my priorities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938670">First of all, I believe it is important and fair to admit the biggest challenge we have inside our health care system is access to care. Too many people struggle to get inside the system and end up in the emergency room for non-urgent health care issues or worse, a problem that could have been treated earlier by a family physician or a group practice. We need to work in collaboration with provinces and territories to see how we can collectively make things better for patients. I know my provincial and territorial counterparts are working on increasing the number of professionals trained in their regions.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8938671">However, while the supply of professionals is increasing, demand is growing even faster.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938672">About one third of internationally trained health professionals work in a different field. We need to do a lot better than that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938673">In a week, I will be meeting with my provincial and territorial counterparts in Calgary for our annual meeting. I sincerely hope that we will make progress in improving credential recognition and mobility for professionals across provinces. I have already had discussions with them, and I am very hopeful.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8938675">Last month, I visited Moderna's new plant in Laval with <Affiliation DbId="318681" Type="96">Minister Joly</Affiliation>. We need more investments like this here in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938676">That's why we're cutting unnecessary red tape and speeding up and updating approval processes. We're doing this for drug approvals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938677">Investments in health care in Canada protect patients and increase access to care. They also create growth and good jobs and reduce our reliance on other countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938678">We are also working with the Pest Management Regulatory Agency and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to reduce red tape for farmers.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8938681">Even though 95% of doctors use electronic medical records, they are often not integrated with each other or with the rest of the system. This creates unnecessary barriers and burdens, particularly in isolated rural communities and indigenous communities.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8938688">Before closing, there is one issue I would like to raise with this group. This summer, I did a tour, and there was one topic that came up again and again: mental health. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938689">Mental health has been putting immense pressure on our health care system over the last few years.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8938690">We are facing a mental health and addiction crisis here in Canada. There is no quick fix, but we must do something to improve the situation. It is essential for the well-being of Canadians, and also for building a stronger Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938691">Mental illness costs an estimated $65 billion a year in Canada alone. We must all work together—parliamentarians, doctors, nurses, community organizations, provinces and territories—to address this issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938692">I would also like to talk to you about the Canadian Dental Care Plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938693">Exactly one week ago, we announced that over 5 million Canadians were now enrolled in the program and eligible for dental care, including over 2 million people in Ontario alone, 1.5 million in Quebec, 138,000 in Manitoba, 338,000 people in Alberta and 685,000 people in British Columbia. Of the Canadians enrolled, 2.8 million have already received care, and the program saves them an average of $800 per year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938694">In addition, 98% of dentists across the country participate in this program. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938695">This is good news for Canadians across the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938696">In closing, I would like to point out that in 2024, the health sector in Canada contributed $301 billion to our GDP. This sector accounts for 3.5 million jobs, or 15% of the Canadian workforce. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938697">Let's not forget that to contribute to their communities and keep our economy strong, Canadians must be healthy. I am here today surrounded by several health officials so that we can work together to achieve this goal.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938698">I would be happy to answer your questions. </ParaText>

People who have been trained abroad are also part of this number. In that respect, I am working closely with the provinces and territories, and they are being very open, given the needs. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938764">That said, this issue does not fall directly under the jurisdiction of the federal government. What we can do is accelerate the process of recognizing credentials. As you know, Employment and Social Development Canada has a program for that. We are also working with the Federation of Medical Regulatory Authorities of Canada to develop a national license to address the issue of credential recognition.</ParaText>

I would like to remind you that in December 2024, I asked Health Canada to provide the committee with the Sun Life contract, but we still have not received anything. Last week, I asked Mr. Orencsak to do so, but we still have not received it.

First, this would allow information to be collected so that women, and others, could be better informed about the risks and make a free and informed decision. This registry would also make it possible to issue recalls in the event of a problem. In addition, this registry would make it possible to collect reliable data that could be used for research and to monitor the long-term safety of breast implants. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8938871">I would like to return to the report tabled by the Standing Committee on Health in 2023. Recommendation 10 suggested that the government fund research on breast implants to better understand their long-term effects on women's health.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938872">Health Canada required companies to conduct research on long-term effects, but this research was shelved without Health Canada even responding or taking action.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938873">In fact, two years after beginning the data analysis it was supposed to conduct on long-term effects, Allergan had lost track of 40% of the women participating in the study. Mentor, which was supposed to do the same, had lost track of 80% of the participants in its study after three years. Furthermore, no other studies on long-term effects were required by Health Canada. In addition, there is still no breast implant registry that would allow such studies to be conducted. It's like the chicken and the egg.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938874">Health Canada is responsible for ensuring that breast implants are 100% safe. How can you look women in the eye and tell them with a clean conscience that Health Canada is fine with them getting implants when we don't know anything about the long-term effects because we don't have any data on it? That was your job. This problem has been around for 30 years, and it still hasn't been addressed. Aren't you ashamed?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8938936"> I will shift gears, because, Minister, you mentioned that mental health is one of your top issues. Indeed, I've had many conversations in my riding and across the board in the province about mental health issues in youth, especially after coming out of the pandemic. It's impacting a whole generation of young people quite a bit, and it is definitely a top concern of mine.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8938938">One of my priorities is the mental health of Canadians, particularly young Canadians, and I would say even more so young Canadian men, since the suicide rate among young men is currently much higher than among young women. This priority is fully in line with the mandate given to us by the <Affiliation DbId="314774" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to protect Canadians. It also has a direct impact on the productivity of all Canadians. The more people are affected, the less productive they are for the economy, of course. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938939">Following research conducted by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, a model for young people emerged. This is the integrated youth services model. The equivalent in Quebec is called the aire ouverte. These are centres created by and for young people, where young people can go not only for services, but also for broader medical support, for example from social workers, or simply to hang out. It's a model that works very well. I have visited several of these facilities across the country. I encourage you to do the same. My belief is that, in the long term, we need to increase the use of these centres. The closer they are to communities, the more accessible they are to young people.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938940">In addition, as you know, the 988 helpline also exists as a preventive measure. More than 600,000 people have already used it. It is definitely another tool that allows people to quickly access services in a crisis.</ParaText>

There are so many factors that can lead to these kinds of problems, so there are many different ways to address them. Supervised consumption sites and treatment are avenues to explore. In addition, drugs are becoming more and more complex over time. So we need to look at that. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938992">Honestly, we will have this conversation with our provincial counterparts. I believe that the provinces are trying different things. In fact, we must not be overly dogmatic at this time, but simply try different approaches. When something does not work, we must be honest enough to acknowledge it and continue working to find the best solution. I have already discussed this with my provincial and territorial counterparts, and one positive development is that they are willing to look at who has tried what and what the best practices are to see how we can achieve better results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8938993">It is certainly a scourge; no one wants to see people dying, and no one wants to see people struggling with addiction.

However, later, B.C. said that, from my understanding and from your reply, they wanted the exemption to be removed for public places, meaning that you're still allowed to use drugs in private.

              <ParaText id="8939130">For example, the study by Anna Wilkinson, Carmina Ng, Larry Ellison and Jean Seely in The Oncologist in 2024 breaks that down. What you see in that series of bell curves is that the peak for the age of breast cancer diagnosis for white women is around 65 years of age in terms of the final peak.

For the supervised consumption sites, the organizations come in and seek an exemption for the possession and the use of the substances in their locations. We do get a sense of how much it costs to run the actual site, but the needles and the distribution are separate programs. Funding is provided by the community, by the municipality, by the province. The needle distribution programs are separate from supervised consumption sites in that they have different sources of funding, but they are often done in a site or in a community health centre.</ParaText>

April is when we are currently targeting to onboard the program, but I can tell you that this is a very active phase for us. We're working very closely with colleagues interdepartmentally to take advantage of their expertise. For example, we're working with Service Canada and with our colleagues at Innovation, Science and Economic Development, which has comparable programs that we are absolutely learning from and building upon.</ParaText>

Recognizing the independence of the program, we are still working with Oxaro through the appropriate governance to make sure these issues are carefully considered by the program.</ParaText>
