              <ParaText id="8901123">Quickly, everyone, we had invited the president of Canada Post to come in for, as we said, October 9, as part of our study. This of course was all done before the changes and the current labour dispute, so they quite understandably have said that they are unavailable and would like to be considered for a future time down the road. I'm just letting you know that we won't continue with them or do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8901124"> We had previously asked the public sector integrity commissioner to attend. She's now back in the country and we have taken the liberty of starting the process to invite her in for October 9. That's kind of pushing back other changes, and again, depending on what's going on with the labour dispute, we'll have to address the president of Canada Post coming later for that time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8901125">This happened about a year ago, I think, when we invited him and then the strike happened. It appears that maybe OGGO inviting him is what triggers the strikes. I apologize to Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8901139">We do not do anything in camera in this committee unless it's specifically confidential information or reports. You can request.... I don't see a will from one side of the room. We could do a vote, but I don't see that happening, Ms. Rochefort.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8901140">I did see some nods about requesting that he come earlier. Can we consider that a motion by the committee to invite him to appear preferably in the next week or, if not, in the first week after break week? If he can appear next week, we can move back.... We'll make our time on Tuesday available.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8901141"> Instead of doing the CG report, we can move the CG report to Thursday if we can get <Affiliation DbId="318684" Type="4">Minister Lightbound</Affiliation> on Tuesday.

Notwithstanding the very current issues, I'm wondering if we could just open it up for questions around his mandate.

              <ParaText id="8901147">I think that was the intent. Rather than having it delayed to November, it's to have him kill two birds with one stone, or to do his meeting with us for two hours. Then he would not be back until the estimates, in which case we usually invite them for one hour with the estimates, which would be in late November or December. I think that's the understanding.</ParaText>
