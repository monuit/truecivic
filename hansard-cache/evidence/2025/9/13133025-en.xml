              <ParaText id="8891765"> I just wanted to bring up that under the previous committee, we decided on the next study, which was the cancer study. We have not seen fit to prioritize that, and I think that is a big mistake. I think we all know many people affected by cancer. Our committee has not studied this in six years. The Canadian Cancer Society has really promoted and was in favour of the cancer study.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8891766"> I'll put notice out there. I certainly hope that all the other members of the committee remember this, and that, at some point, we adopt the previous study that was approved by all members of this committee, which is the cancer study. The number one cause of death of Canadians is cancer. It's not antimicrobial resistance or the lack of drugs, etc.</ParaText>
