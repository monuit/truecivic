              <ParaText id="8888562">The motion concerns our meeting next Monday. I would like us to start this new parliamentary session on the right foot by receiving an update on one of the major issues currently affecting the agricultural and agri‑food sectors. This issue concerns all aspects of tariffs. I'm thinking, for example, of the tariffs imposed by China on canola, pork and peas. We hear a great deal about this key topic. However, I would like an update.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888563">I propose that we spend an hour with officials from Agriculture and Agri‑Food Canada, as well as representatives from Global Affairs Canada and the Department of Finance. There have been announcements regarding programs to help our canola producers, for example. I would like witnesses to come talk about the impact of these programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888564">I would like us to spend the second hour talking to stakeholders affected by tariffs. I would like to hear from them to see whether the support is actually sufficient.</ParaText>

This doesn't preclude other things that may come up. Certainly, there will be some emergent issues, but I think this gives us a good template for now until the Christmas recess.</ParaText>

As I've mentioned, Mr. Bragdon might want us to look into the drought in Atlantic Canada.</ParaText>

I think that we want to provide relevant information. We all know that corporate risk management systems no longer work and that they aren't suited to the climate change situation or to resilience in the face of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888716">I would like us to adopt this motion. I don't understand why the committee isn't adopting it. We've always been clear on this point. The committee has always been the master of its own business. We could adopt it. We clearly agreed on this in the subcommittee. However, it might also be a good idea to adopt the motion during a public committee meeting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888717">Furthermore, it was made clear that we had other topics to propose and that, as a result, the committee would retain some flexibility in its business calendar. I don't see how adopting this resolution interferes with the flexibility of the business calendar.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888718">I already told my colleagues that I plan to ask the committee to take another look at some issues, such as the reciprocity of standards, a topic that we studied in the previous Parliament. However, I want to do this at the appropriate time, not right now. I also want the committee to take another look at food labelling. Mr. Barlow will surely raise other issues as well, and so will Ms. Chatel and her team. As a result, the committee must decide on the flexibility of its business calendar.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888719">I think that this motion is relevant. I'm prepared to adopt it. The motion doesn't specify when the committee will carry out the study, but it does state that the study will be done before June 2026. If the other committee members don't want to adopt it, I'll go along with them. However, I think that we should adopt it today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8888735"> On the review, I understand that with the way the federal-provincial partnership is being negotiated, if we want to have a relevant impact.... My information from the department is that they will start working seriously in the summer of 2026. If we want our recommendation to have an impact, it has to be before June. After that, it will have less of an impact, just because of the timeline of the negotiation of the FPT partnership agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8888736"> That's the reason for the timeline.</ParaText>
