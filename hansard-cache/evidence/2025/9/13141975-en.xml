My understanding was that the Liberals were going to have dates for the minister. In good faith, we didn't pull any stunts or anything like that to resurrect that motion. I was advised by my counterpart—and I don't put any blame on him—that there is no date for the minister because we have not invited the minister, as is required by a motion. </ParaText>

The minister has obviously not had the greatest of weeks. We're dealing with crime. We're dealing with a confiscation on which there's a secret recording. We don't know what's what. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8900456">I'm Craig Oldham. I'm one of the directors general in the crime prevention branch of Public Safety. I am largely responsible overall for the national action plan to combat auto theft.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900457">As highlighted in the RCMP's Criminal Intelligence Service Canada report from December 2023, the issue of vehicle theft in Canada had been steadily increasing in the years prior to 2024. From 2021 to 2023, Ontario and Quebec saw larger than normal surges in auto theft. Ontario witnessed a 78% increase in violent carjacking, while vehicle theft rates in Quebec rose by 50%. The involvement of organized crime groups in the vehicle theft market also augmented significantly during the same time.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8900458">These circumstances warranted a swift and thorough response, and this is exactly what we have been collectively delivering across impacted jurisdictions since then.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8900459">With the February 2024 national summit on auto theft and the follow-on launching of the national action plan on combatting auto theft, the federal government has worked steadily with an array of partners to advance a number of initiatives to prevent auto theft, recover stolen vehicles, stop their export and combat the organized crime networks behind the crime.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8900460">As you may be aware, the national action plan on combatting auto theft has so far been updated on two occasions: first on October 16, 2024, followed by a second update on March 8, 2025.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8900461">Through collaborative efforts with provincial, territorial, municipal and industrial partners, and as highlighted in the March 8, 2025, update, we continue to see positive results from these dedicated actions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900462">In the first half of 2025, national auto theft trends have decreased by 19.1%, compared to the same period in 2024. This is from the Équité Association's “First Half of 2025: Auto Theft Trend Report”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900463">The Canada Border Services Agency intercepted 2,277 stolen vehicles at its marine and intermodal ports in 2024, with significant interceptions in Quebec and Ontario. In addition, 1,155 vehicles have been detained thus far in 2025.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900464">Finally, since integrating data from the Canadian Police Information Centre with Interpol's stolen vehicle database, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have received 4,312 notifications and 889 international collaboration requests via Interpol's stolen motor vehicle database.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8900465">As we know too well, organized crime groups and networks are quick to adapt, and that is why Public Safety Canada, or PS; RCMP; CBSA and other involved federal departments continue to work actively with our partners to ensure a comprehensive and agile response to this evolving criminal trend.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8900466"> This includes gathering provincial and territorial partners in early October to assess the overall progress and to agree on an approach to further engagement with industry partners beyond the existing national auto theft plan-related activities. This also includes continued work with Interpol so that they can further continue to contribute in tackling transnational organized crime.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900467">I would like to point out that as part of that success story, Interpol, in collaboration with 12 West African countries, conducted a successful operation in March of this year, during which most of the vehicles intercepted originated from Canada.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8900473">Auto theft is a complex issue driven by organized crime that fuels broader criminal networks and undermines public confidence. It requires more than a single agency to address; it demands a unified, coordinated response. Auto theft has personal, social and economic impacts and is a priority for the Canada Border Services Agency.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8900474">Our adversaries are transnational criminals who collaborate across borders. Successfully disrupting and defeating them therefore also depends on collaboration. The Canada Border Services Agency is working with law enforcement partners and stakeholders such as the Équité Association to support the continued work on combatting auto theft.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900475">Prior to and after the national summit on combatting auto theft in February 2024, the agency has been focused on auto theft. We have responded to 100% of referrals received from the police of jurisdiction, and over 1,800 interceptions of stolen vehicles were made in 2023.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900476">In 2024, the Canada Border Services Agency intercepted 2,277 stolen vehicles, and in 2025, as of September 23, 1,155 have been intercepted. These interceptions were driven by referrals from policing partners and our own intelligence-driven targeting. This highlights the importance of strong partnerships and coordinated efforts among the CBSA, the RCMP, and provincial and municipal police services, as well as with other key stakeholders.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8900480">The Canada Border Services Agency, in partnership with the Department of Justice, continues to review its legislative frameworks. A review of reporting obligations and compliance measures is in progress to ensure that the CBSA has the necessary tools, laws and regulations to detect stolen vehicles before they are exported.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900481">Équité Association is reporting a 19.1% decrease in auto theft in the first half of 2025 compared to 2024, which I would argue—and it's echoed by Équité—is the result of the collective efforts of police of jurisdiction, the RCMP, the Canada Border Services Agency, the Équité Association and other partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900482">The Équité Association report also notes significant decreases of theft in Ontario, which is down 25.9%, and in Quebec, which is down 22.2%. These are provinces that previously experienced the highest auto theft rates from 2021 to 2023.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8900487">Good afternoon, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much for the opportunity to provide an update to the committee on the RCMP's work to combat auto theft as part of the national action plan. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900488">My name is Liam Price, and I am the director general of international special services within federal policing at the RCMP. It's a hard title. Essentially, it's our relations with Interpol, our posts overseas and our peace operations around the world.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8900489">Addressing auto theft requires strong partnerships. Co-operation among police services, governments, industry and international partners is essential to addressing this agile, resilient and persistent threat. While the investigation of each auto theft incident falls under the police of jurisdiction in Canada, the RCMP plays three essential roles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900490">First, our federal policing mandate enables us to investigate the most serious threats to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900491">Second, we also take a leadership role as the national police force supporting provincial and municipal efforts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900492">Finally, we act as the local police force in communities under contract.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="8900493">Under the pillars of the action plan, the RCMP, as co-lead or lead, is responsible for a number of activities. I'd like to provide some highlights of our efforts and then focus on my area of responsibility, which is international co-operation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900494">Domestically, as you've heard from my colleagues, the RCMP continues to participate in multiple active joint task forces across the country. These include, for example in Quebec, Project Rechercher, which is led by the Sûreté du Québec. Also, there is Project Vector, which is led by the Ontario Provincial Police. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900495">These efforts aim to disrupt organized crime activities for stolen vehicles at all stages, and they are producing results. Overall, Project Rechercher has led to some of the seizures you've heard about already, such as the seizure of some 1,300 stolen vehicles, as well as the repatriation of more than 100 from overseas. This has resulted in 48 arrests and more than $1 billion in funds seized, and to date, Project Vector has contributed to the seizure of many of the vehicles intercepted at the port of Montreal that were bound for overseas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900496">We also continue to collect, analyze and disseminate intelligence to inform our collective direction, and we deliver training to support our collective efforts. Criminal Intelligence Service Canada and the Canadian Police College, which are both hosted by the RCMP, are leaders in these areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900497">Let me now shift to my area of responsibility from the more transnational perspective. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900498">Auto theft is an issue that goes beyond Canada's borders. It is a global phenomenon that requires global responses. To this end, as you've heard from my colleagues, we've significantly expanded our efforts to share information about Canadian stolen vehicles with foreign partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900499">Since February 2024, data from CPIC, the Canadian Police Information Centre, has been integrated with Interpol's stolen motor vehicle database. That means details on more than 150,000 stolen cars from Canada are now integrated in the global fight around the world. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900500">By sharing this data, we have made it easier for foreign police to identify whether a car in front of them may have been stolen here in Canada. This is working. As you've heard, we've received notification that foreign police have checked and found stolen Canadian cars more than 4,000 times. On the back of that, we've received hundreds of requests for collaboration on investigations. As a result, that's helping us recover stolen vehicles and target the networks behind the thefts. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900501">However, we are doing more than that. We're also taking this effort overseas. As you heard from Director General Oldham, we are deploying experts as part of multinational operations, such as Operation Safe Wheels under the auspices of Interpol, which is funded by Canada, to West Africa to help local authorities there target imports of vehicles to the region by organized crime. Many of the vehicles we found there with Interpol and with local authorities did come from Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900502">In closing, I would just like to reiterate that the RCMP remains engaged with partners to combat auto theft and to ensure that criminals are held to account. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900503"> We know that criminal networks are quick to adapt, and we appreciate the ongoing collaboration among partners to deprive criminal groups of this important profit centre and reduce harm to our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900504">I look forward to answering any questions committee members may have today.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8900585"> The fight against auto theft, I would suggest, is a team sport, and it would be difficult to point to one single action. I would very much suggest that probably our greatest strength has been the collaboration portion of this, bringing the partners—municipal, federal and international, through Interpol—together to do the intelligence-based law enforcement that allows us to target and zero in on the problems.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900586">I would suggest that there have been a number of regulatory and legislative changes as well that have also enhanced our ability to reduce the number of auto thefts and to make this less attractive to organized crime, which, much like water, will always follow the path of least resistance and go where they think the profits are the highest. The more deterrence we put here, the less engagement.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8900589">When I look at the results for the Canada Border Services Agency, I see that we recovered in the order of 2,300 vehicles last year. We're on track to do about 1,500 this year, and I think that's an indication of auto theft going down. That's all entirely due to collaboration with our policing partners. When we've identified stolen vehicles, it's been based on police referrals, on the new intelligence capacity that we've built and our new targeting tool that we've developed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900590">In the Toronto area rail yards, we deployed two scanners to look randomly for vehicles. We have done 6,500 scans so far this year, and we've not identified any stolen vehicles as a result of those 6,500 scans, so the success is working with partners, the success is taking an intelligence-driven approach and the success is based on collaboration.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900591">Our president has convened chiefs of police about seven times since the auto theft summit to coordinate efforts, and I've convened my counterparts about 25 times, all with a view to making sure that we're all working together, all collaborating, to identify stolen vehicles and defeat the organized crime behind it.</ParaText>

The Secretary General of Interpol highlighted Canada's inclusion of all of the stolen motor vehicle data in Interpol's databases as a global best practice and one that should be emulated by countries around the world. That has led to our finding connections we didn't know were there, and that's really important to sealing off the vulnerabilities that Mr. Oldham spoke about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900594">I'm very proud of that collaboration. It needs to continue, and we are continuing it. Later this fall, we will be at the next Interpol global conference on vehicle crime, talking about evolving trends that we're seeing around the world.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8900600">Gentlemen, thank you for your remarks. It's unfortunate that we don't have more time to delve into this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900601">I wasn't part of the auto theft study, but I have read the Government of Canada's national action plan on combatting auto theft and its follow-ups, and I have to tell you sincerely that, from the outside, it seems as though everyone is making an effort, but the root of the problem isn't being addressed. I'll explain what I mean by that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900602">A professional Radio-Canada journalist recently said, on the <I>Enquête</I> program, that organized crime offenders from West Africa were very active in car theft. The method used for arriving in Canada is to apply for a study permit, which is granted by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, or IRCC. However, neither IRCC nor Global Affairs Canada seems to be involved in the national action plan. There is no accountability and no follow-up.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900603">It seems to me that Global Affairs Canada should establish protocols with Côte d'Ivoire and inform us of how their relationship evolves. IRCC, for its part, should show how it can better monitor the issuance of study permits and better track students from West Africa. I think those are the major omissions from the national action plan, because those departments aren't accountable for helping to reduce vehicle theft.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900604">I also don't get the impression that there's more space for border officers at the Port of Montreal. I don't think Mr. McCrorie is surprised to hear that. There aren't more hired border officers either. I think there are about eight specifically dedicated to combatting auto theft.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900605">In short, I see improvements, but some stakeholders are missing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900606">What do you think of my idea to take the national action plan and add active participation by Global Affairs Canada and IRCC when it comes to issuing study permits for students from West Africa?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8900608"> You're absolutely right. This was an interesting case in which CBSA played a very active role with the police of local jurisdiction to conduct an investigation. In part, this was driven by some of the findings that CBSA inland investigators generated in working with FINTRAC as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900609">Part of our normal working relationship with IRCC is in fact based on the information we have gathered through this exercise. We share that with IRCC so they can do a better job when they are issuing student permits. It's also a little bit on CBSA, because some of those student visas will come to us for background checks. That will inform us in terms of how we do background checks prior to a visa being issued.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900610">The other part I would highlight is that the police are going to play their role in doing the criminal investigation and ultimately charging people. For example, if students who are foreign nationals are convicted, then we will remove them. They would be inadmissible as a result of criminality or serious criminality. One of the consequences, once they are done with the criminal system, is that we would remove them. We're actively pursuing that.</ParaText>

When we receive tips or when we receive information that there may be students, for example, involved in criminality, we will pursue that or share that information with police. To the extent that we have information about it, we will either work with them or let them pursue their criminal investigations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900617">We don't actively monitor every student in the country and we don't actively monitor every foreign national in the country, but when we do receive information about criminality, we will pursue that.

By rough math, we're probably going to intercept about 1,500 vehicles. That's still higher than the years prior to 2022. In 2022 it was about 1,300 vehicles, so we're still seeing more. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900638">When you look at the combination of the number of vehicles we're intercepting and the decline in auto theft, I'm not pretending that CBSA is the only answer, but I think the point is that we've been working very well with our partners, which is having an impact on auto theft. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8900640">I'm well aware that it's a significant issue, because if criminals are not shipping vehicles out as much, they're still stealing vehicles. It's estimated that in the first half of this year, 23,000 vehicles were stolen. These are bound for domestic sale, within Canada. Carfax just released a report saying that 372,000 cloned VINs, or vehicle identification numbers, are currently in operation in Canada today. Of those, 127,000 are Ontario-registered vehicles.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900641">I'm very concerned. I know that this is a provincial issue as well, but hundreds of thousands of Canadians are driving vehicles that potentially are stolen vehicles. What are we going to do about it when these people find out that the vehicles they're depending on for their livelihoods were stolen? Are there any plans on how we're going to deal with that?</ParaText>

With Carfax providing a reporting service on whether your VIN is a real VIN or a cloned VIN, if you find out that your VIN is cloned, you're talking about a $50,000 loss, and potentially even more, in terms of what you paid for that vehicle.

              <ParaText id="8900660"> I appreciate the numbers you shared from the Équité Association report. That is a drastic change since last year, since 2024.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900661">In the numbers that you gave, you mentioned that Ontario had an almost 26% decrease. This is thanks to the civilian and uniformed members of law enforcement and also thanks to the Halton Regional Police Service, which is headquartered in my riding. Their Project Credit investigation revealed a sophisticated auto theft network operating in the GTA that included chop shops and revinning the vehicles. Those domestic chop shops are now expanding to ship parts internationally.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900662">The Équité Association report also notes the RCMP's role in providing stolen vehicle data to Interpol as a key part of the successful strategy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900663">With criminals now targeting provinces like Alberta for international export and even expanding domestic chop shops to ship parts internationally, how is the enhanced data sharing with international partners like Interpol empowering the RCMP to disrupt these evolving global criminal networks at their source and at their destination points?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8900666">One of the great things about the RCMP is that it is a big tent with jurisdictions across Canada, so the sharing of data is happening organically. We were out in Winnipeg just last month talking with the Winnipeg Police Service and with police officers from across the west about the vehicle theft problem and sharing the lessons that have been learned from central Canada already.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900667">That is happening on a daily basis through awareness and things like the purple notices that go out through Interpol. It's a key part of our effort, so that we don't have to relearn the problem time and again.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8900674">One of the great things about the collaboration among all levels and all of the various partnerships has been our ability to use that collaboration to adjust our strategies. You described the movement from the export of full vehicles to chop shops. There's the movement from stealing cars physically to stealing them by fraud. Those are adjustments that we're making within the strategy at a very organic level. We're applying it as those data points come up in various other jurisdictions. We're sharing with international partners when we learn that there's a network that may have been active in one country and it has suddenly moved to another, and this group of folks is in your backyard, so let's pay attention to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8900675">To respond a little bit to an earlier question, one danger in focusing on just one group of people is that the organized crime milieu is quite a complex ecosystem, not necessarily from any one country or one background. We really need to use those lessons and investigations to focus on the people who are committing the crimes in the round.</ParaText>
