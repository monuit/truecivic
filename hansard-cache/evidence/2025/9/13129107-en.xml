              <ParaText id="8889243">Madam Chair, we adopted the report from the subcommittee meeting we held last week, containing recommendations to the committee on the work we could schedule for the next few weeks of meetings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889244">I would first like to make sure that everyone is comfortable with the fact that we want to invite Ms. Eatrides, the chair of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, or CRTC, and Ms. Bouchard, the president of CBC/Radio-Canada, on the proposed dates so that the clerk can quickly extend the invitations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889245">Next, there's a study on artificial intelligence that we discussed at the subcommittee last week that seemed to have consensus around the table. I suggest that we start this study right away. It's a motion to undertake a study to assess the impacts of AI on cultural industries. This is a fairly broad field of study, and it will certainly give rise to some very interesting exchanges. I think we could open the discussion on this study.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889246">My motion proposed four meetings, but that was really a minimum. When I drafted my motion, I expected there would be a lot of study proposals for this fall. I assumed that we would want to make room for other topics, but I think this is a major study. I think this is a major issue for all sectors, not just the cultural one. I feel that we would need a minimum of five meetings, while leaving the door open to more meetings if committee members agree to add them. Since we are meeting with the chair of the CRTC and the president of CBC/Radio-Canada, this study could also take place around those meetings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889247">Therefore, with the committee's agreement, I would make this study a priority. If you want, we can discuss it. If not, I think we can pass the motion by voting right now. It would save us time, which would be wonderful.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889268">Good morning, everyone. I am pleased to be sitting on the committee with you for this session. I'm extremely glad to be here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889269">I understand that we just passed the motion to adopt a motion aimed at conducting a study on artificial intelligence. I would just like to bring to the committee's attention that, over the past two years, the Standing Committee on Industry has studied Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C‑27</Document>, which had an artificial intelligence component. We've heard from a lot of witnesses on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889270">If I understand Mr. Champoux's motion correctly, the idea here is to conduct a study on artificial intelligence as it relates to creative industries. It's important to understand that artificial intelligence is an extremely broad subject. It's very, very wide-ranging. If we want to limit our study to the creative industries, at the very least we need to define what those are. Otherwise, we could cast a really wide net.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889271">The other point I would like to raise is that the main motion passed earlier asks us to submit witnesses within 48 hours for a study that I consider extremely important. That's an extremely short time frame for us to find all the witnesses needed to carry out a study. Could we submit witness lists, start the study and then have the option of adding other witnesses later on? It will be hard for us to draw up a list of all the relevant witnesses we would like to see during the five meetings of this study in 48 hours. There may be witnesses from other organizations we want to meet with. We would need the option of adding witnesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889272">I also agree that we should hold five meetings. I think this study is very important. As we know, AI is already very prevalent in our lives, and this is just the beginning. I therefore suggest that we move forward and adopt this motion today, but that we ask Mr. Champoux to provide a precise definition of what a creative industry is. I think it's important to study the subject of his motion in five meetings, while being able to add witnesses during the study. I find that 48 hours is much too short a time to come up with a list of appropriate witnesses for this study.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889285">We did indeed specify that we would submit a list of preliminary witnesses by Wednesday to allow us to begin the study. We can obviously add witnesses later and take a bit more time to think about our list.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889286">As for defining the creative industries, as the chair said earlier, I don't think it's essential. We know what we're referring to when we talk about creative industries and there may be individuals in a specific sector of the creative industries you'd like to include in this study. The Liberals may have a different idea, us too, but I think we're capable of understanding the definition of creative industry in the context of this study.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889287">I'm in favour too of having at least five witnesses. Just based on today's conversation, I think that number could be higher. So I believe we should keep that in mind too. I think this study has the potential to come back.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889288">Furthermore, what Mr. Généreux is saying is true. In the previous Parliament, the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology considered Bill <Document DbId="11873796" Type="3">C‑27</Document>. It dealt mainly with AI, but the impacts are being directly felt by artisans and content creators and in all sectors of the creative industries. We must be able to anticipate some of the challenges. I think we have often been behind the curve of technological progress over the past 30 years and we still are. Then, I think there are things we will hear from the witnesses we invite. They'll tell us how much we need to regulate in some areas.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889289">Perhaps the committee will reach that conclusion, but this study will truly help us have a better understanding of the effects on the creative industries, in particular.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889298"> Based on what he said, Mr. Champoux presumes we all agree on the definition of cultural industry. I'd still like to include a written definition, so that we can move forward without ambiguity or any misinterpretation of what a cultural industry is. A definition could state, for example, that “a cultural industry designates all economic activities that produce, distribute and market goods and services related to arts, culture and creative activities.” In other words, these are sectors where artistic and cultural creation is transformed into products or services for public consumption, be it in cinema, audio-visual media, music, entertainment, publishing, books, newspapers, graphic novels, video games, visual arts, fashion and architecture. It's quite broad. Therefore, if we imply a definition without putting anything in writing, we risk lacking focus.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889315">I'm still in agreement when we talk about undertaking studies on the journalism and media sectors. I agree with the proposal to hold five meetings. I consider this study to be broad enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889316">I also note that, yet again, there is a request to invite the CEO of CBC Radio-Canada to testify for two hours as part of this study. I understand full well the importance of the public broadcaster in the Canadian and Quebec news ecosystem. However, I think there are other major players in the news media sector and so I am somewhat reticent to set aside a two-hour meeting just for the CEO of CBC Radio-Canada as part of this study. That's a lot. There's nothing to prevent us from inviting her, I think it's quite relevant, but there are other challenges facing Quebecor, Cogeco Media, as well as the newspapers and all sectors of journalism in Quebec and Canada. I get the impression that devoting two hours of this study just to CBC Radio-Canada may distract us a little from this study. I am a little less comfortable with that part of the motion. I move it simply be removed.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889317">I quite agree with the motion to invite the <Affiliation DbId="318663" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> again. I don't see a problem with having the CEO of CBC Radio-Canada as part of this study. However, I am really much less comfortable with setting aside two hours for her appearance. I get the feeling that industry stakeholders, particularly those from Quebec with whom I've been speaking, might say that the committee is inviting Ms. Bouchard yet again, and that CBC Radio-Canada is in the spotlight yet again, whereas those stakeholders would like more time to speak and, once again, be heard by the committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889318">I would amend the motion by moving simply that the invitation to the CEO of CBC Radio-Canada be withdrawn.

I am bothered by the fact that we would reserve an entire meeting for CBC Radio-Canada in a study on journalism and the media sector in Quebec and Canada. However, I think it's important for us to set aside some time and have the CEO of CBC Radio-Canada appear as a witness in this study.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889335">I would reword my amendment slightly to find a way to say that we want the <Affiliation DbId="318663" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Identity and Culture</Affiliation> to be with us for an entire meeting. I think that's important, because the study falls under his department and his area of responsibility. We can have him testify for two hours. I would also state we want the CEO of CBC Radio-Canada to appear, but without specifying the length of her appearance. We are committing then to inviting her as a witness but not necessarily for an entire meeting. If she came during a meeting with other witnesses, so be it. That can be decided later.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889336">I would simply like to amend the motion to invite the minister for a two-hour meeting, which is appropriate, and I would move we add that Ms. Bouchard, the CEO of CBC Radio-Canada, be simply added to the list of witnesses for this study. Would that wording allow us to reach an agreement?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889354"> I do like this from Mr. Champoux. We've had a number of incidents over the last six months in this country where CBC has gone into areas in Quebec, and, I can tell you, in Alberta—namely, Lloydminster and Medicine Hat—where they've squeezed the traditional media right out. I do think that, since Madame Bouchard has hired.... They've promoted this: “We have reporters in Lethbridge, Medicine Hat and all over.” She was here touting that, along with Ms. Tait. It is their game plan to eliminate media in other zones. I will challenge them when they come. They've done a very good job of eliminating a 50-year station in Lloydminster and a 70-year station in Medicine Hat. That was their game plan, to hire reporters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889355">Madam Chair, you used to be a reporter. They have unlimited resources. I look forward to CBC coming and answering why they hired 30 additional reporters in specific regions where they knew the local media currently there was very vulnerable.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889359">I wanted specifically to respond to Mr. Myles's question. Several topics under committee business will relate to CBC Radio-Canada. The appearance by Ms. Bouchard, scheduled for October 8, if it works, will allow us to address a variety of topics. However, when we delve into the study on journalism, for example, that will be a different study, during which we will invite back the CEO of CBC Radio-Canada. What I mean by that is that we won't take advantage of one appearance to talk about both the study we will undertake in three months' time and the events that took place this summer and to which Mr. Waugh is referring. We invite witnesses one study at a time, even if some return rather often. Over the past few years, the committee has become familiar with several faces.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="8889389">Usually, when we invite the <Affiliation DbId="318663" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> for two hours, he only comes for one. That will be the case on Wednesday: we invited him to a two-hour meeting, but he will only be here for one hour. We will have the deputy ministers for the second hour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889390">The minister must be accountable: It's his department. This will be an important study and it will be quite separate from his appearance next week. We're talking about a study on AI, which will take place in the coming weeks and will last several weeks. I don't believe it will be too exhausting for him to appear twice before committee in that period.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="8889391">Furthermore, let me repeat that this file is directly related to his department. We are inviting him for two hours, which is entirely reasonable. He will probably again negotiate with us to come for just one hour. What do you expect? Ministers' schedules are like that. That said, it is reasonable to invite him for two hours, meaning for the full meeting, and it's entirely reasonable in the context of a study like this.</ParaText>
